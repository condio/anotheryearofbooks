<p>Well, this is it. The last book review of 2020. After finishing <em>The Vanishing Half</em>, I wanted to read one more book before I picked up <em>Harry Potter</em> yet again.</p>

I’ve also been keeping my eye on my books list to see if any of the Kindle versions go on sale. That happened with Beach Read.

<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beach-Read-Emily-Henry/dp/1984806734/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ROYAXFKCMDZH&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=beach+read&amp;qid=1608566982&amp;sprefix=beach+read%2Caps%2C157&amp;sr=8-1">Beach Read</a></em><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Emily Henry<br>
<strong>2020 Book Count:</strong> 57</p>
<hr>
<p>January Andrews is a bestselling romance novelist. She has always believed in the happily ever after, until life showed her otherwise. Augustus Everett does not write happy endings; he writes literary fiction. He might not even believe in them. He and January are pretty much opposites. Both are in writing ruts.</p>
<p>January and Gus find themselves as neighbors for three months. One night, they strike a deal. January will try to write the next Great American novel; Gus will write something with a happy ending. To help, each will help the other research, leading to line dancing and interviews of survivors of a death cult.</p>
<p>Over the course of a summer, January and Gus will each confront things that make them uncomfortable. Along the way, each might just get out of that creative rut.</p>
<hr>
<p>By this point, you all know I love rom-com books (I also love rom-com movies). I can’t help myself - I end up picking them up, even if I tell myself I should read more in-depth books. They just keep coming back. But hey, when you like something, you like something!</p>
<p><em>Beach Read</em> is a rom-com about rom-coms, if that makes sense. But it is more than just a light rom-com. It has more emotional baggage than that. The plot described above, and in the book synopsis, doesn’t fully explain what this book is about. I don’t want to give anything away; I was pleasantly surprised when <em>Beach Read</em> took a deeper turn.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading January’s and Gus’s story, following them on rom-com montages and interviews with death cult survivors and learning their secrets. I enjoyed it so much that I read this one in 2.5 days. Beach Read moves quickly, sucking you in with its surprises and rom-commyness. It helped that its secondary characters were fun and involved. They gave the book more depth, rather than only focusing on January and Gus going on their non-dates.</p>
<p><em>Beach Read</em> is a rom-com with baggage. If rom-coms are your thing, like they are mine, add this one to your to-read list.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Next Read:</strong> I’m going to finish 2020 by going back to the <em>Harry Potter</em> series. Stay tuned for the Recap of Another Year of Books: 2020 Edition. It’s coming your way soon.</p>
