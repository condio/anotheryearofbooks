  <div class="content">
    <p>This next read came as a recommendation from a fellow library-goer and reader, known by her family as GMA. That’s right, this book came recommended by Grandma Donna. She told me to read it, told my aunt (probably both of my aunts), and told my sister to read it. She may have told my mom too - not 100% on that one, but I feel confident. So I listened to her advice, and reserved a copy at the library… after 3 weeks, I was still waiting. I took it as a good sign - so instead I bought a copy on Amazon and had it here within two days. It should be noted that on the day after I ordered it, my copy from the library was in transit. You win some, you lose some.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I had high expectations for this one.</p>

<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Where-Crawdads-Sing-Delia-Owens/dp/0735219095/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1567292082&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Where the Crawdads Sing</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Delia Owens<br>
<strong>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition:</strong> 32</p>
<hr>
<p>In Delia Owen’s debut novel, Kya Clark is known around Barkley Cove as “Marsh Girl,” a stranger who is up to no good, dirty and uneducated. When each member of Kya’s family leaves her one by one, she raises herself in the marsh. There she learns to survive, making money by selling fish, finding companions in the birds, lessons in the sand. Aided by the kindness of Jumpin’ and his wife Mabel, Kya grows up embracing the Marsh Girl side of her, living off the land and water. </p>
<p>But something is missing. All the years alone have blocked Kya off from education, from friendship, from love. Enter Tate, a young man who loves the marsh as much as Kya does. After befriending Kya, Tate teaches her how to read. At the age of 14, Kya picks it up quickly, fascinated by all the things she doesn’t know, particularly about the marsh she calls home.</p>
<p>When Tate leaves for college, Kya finds herself alone again, blocking herself off from everyone, except basic interactions. However, with Tate’s advice, Kya becomes a novelist and artist, focused solely on the marsh. With her new found success, Kya can continue to live in the marsh, with everyday comforts she never knew before.</p>
<p>Then Chase Andrews looks her way, and Kya has the eye of two young men from town. Chase is a smooth and big talker, but not so great at following through. Years later, the unthinkable happens and everyone points their fingers at the Marsh Girl. The majority of the town is against her. But are the facts? &hellip;I&rsquo;m not telling.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Where the Crawdads Sing</em> seems to be the IT book to read right now. The cover of my copy says it - it’s part of Reese Witherspoon’s book club (September 2018 pick - I looked it up!). Remember when I mentioned I had high expectations? Let’s just say - GMA did not lead me astray.</p>
<p>It only took me four days to read this book - I know that probably seems fast. Honestly, I think I could have read it faster if I skipped work for a day or two. Reading a good book seems like a perfectly good excuse to not go to work. Once I picked it up, I couldn’t put it down. I’d read it for hours at a time each night.</p>
<p>The book jumps time periods in each chapter, ranging from 1952 when Kya is six to 1969 and 1970 when the unthinkable happens. For some books, this doesn’t work and can be distracting. But for Delia Owens, it works. The novel flows, even with the back and forth. It never seems forced, but instead gives the background needed for Kya’s story. It provides the development of how Kya’s relationships build and how she becomes who she is in 1970. Each character in this book has a strong character development, from Kya to Tate to Tate’s father, who is a minor character. All converges for a unique story of a Marsh Girl, with a twist you may or may not see coming.</p>
<p>There’s a reason this book is the IT book right now. In GMA’s words, it’s a little “weird,” but in this case, weird is good. Really good. Get yourself on the wait list at your local library, because this one is worth the wait. </p>
