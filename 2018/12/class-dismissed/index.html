    <p>In January, it all began with an Elin Hilderbrand book. Well, actually it began with <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/01/the-first-three-of-2018/">multiple Elin Hilderbrand books</a>. It seemed fitting that my 52nd read should be her latest winter novel. On Black Friday, thanks to Amazon, it was purchased. Then it laid around waiting to be read.</p>
<p>So without further ado, the 52nd read of 2018.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Winter-Paradise-Elin-Hilderbrand/dp/0316435511/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545010723&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=winter+in+paradise"><em>Winter in Paradise</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Elin Hilderbrand<br>
<strong>Number of Books Read:</strong> 52</p>
<hr>
<p>Irene and her husband Russ live a seemingly normal life. Their adult children are on their own (mostly), Russ has a great job, though what he actually does no one knows, and Irene, when not working as an magazine editor, is restoring their Victorian home. Life is quiet, life is good.</p>
<p>Then the call comes on New Year’s Eve. Russ has been killed in a helicopter crash on the island of St. John. A place that Irene and her sons never knew Russ visited.</p>
<p>While trying to process the news, Irene and her sons, Baker and Cash, travel to the Caribbean to find answers. There, they find Russ had a secret life, leaving little clues as to what happened and the life he lived while there.</p>
<p>But a local woman, Rosie, was also killed in the crash. Her family and friends are shocked, but knew of an Invisible Man who visited Rosie and her daughter Maia several times a month. Other things about his life? No one seems to know.</p>
<p>Together Russ and Rosie’s families will work through their grief, both together and apart. All will have to face a truth about their own families that no one knew and take a look at their own futures.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m trying not to spoil too much on this one. I know at least my sister (hello Meghan!) will be reading this over the holidays so I’m doing my best to keep this high level. But I digress because the blog must go on.</p>
<p>I’ve read almost all of Hilderbrand’s books (see <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/08/here-comes-the-bride-maybe/">this</a> and <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/01/the-first-three-of-2018/">this</a> for some of them). Out of her 22 novels, this is her first book that hasn’t taken place on Nantucket. I will admit, I did somewhat miss Nantucket in this one.</p>
<p>But, it was still an Elin Hilderbrand book. A quick, somewhat mindless, pretty easy read, as they usually are. Keep in mind: I read this book in less than 3 days - determined to finish it quickly when my sister predicted I would read it in less than two (I tried - I really did).</p>
<p>This book, like her others, is told from multiple points of views, with each prominent character, and some minor characters, getting a part. But with Hilderbrand’s writing, you never feel like you’re missing a piece of the plot with this style. This book was more dramatic, and did feel somewhat different from Hilderbrand’s other novels.</p>
<p>Overall, a worthy read for number 52. While it wasn’t my favorite of Hilderbrand’s, I look forward to the sequel next winter (trust me - there will be one based on the ending).</p>
<p>And just like that, the list is complete (but the year is not, so I’ll keep reading more quietly).</p>
<hr>
<p>Stay tuned for one more post - a recap of Another Year of Books.</p>
