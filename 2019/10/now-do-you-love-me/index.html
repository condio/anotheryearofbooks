    <p>It seems like October crashed into me. I looked up and BAM&hellip; October. I feel like I should have seen it coming considering Giant Eagle had Halloween candy out before school started. This is entirely too soon, by the way. Don’t even get me started on the Christmas decorations that are already out in stores.</p>
<p>Finishing this book means I have 15 more to read to make it to 52 books read in 2019. Less than three months, 15 books. But let’s concentrate on #37 before I get carried away.</p>
<p>Book Read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Marriage-Novel-Tayari-Jones/dp/1616208686/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6UY1C6WBJ5IA&amp;keywords=an+american+marriage&amp;qid=1570329983&amp;sprefix=an+amer%2Caps%2C373&amp;sr=8-1">An American Marriage</a></p>
<p>Author: Tayari Jones</p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 37</p>
<p>Celestial and Roy are newlyweds. He is an executive, working his way up the corporate ladder. She is an artist, creating unique dolls, on the cusp of success. Despite meeting once in college through mutual friend Andre, they reconnected in New York City, whole Celestial was working her way through graduate school and Roy was on a business trip. A romance was kindled one night after Roy chased a bugler and lost a tooth.</p>
<p>A year and a half into their marriage, on a trip to visit Roy’s parents, Roy is accused of a crime he didn’t commit. Then, he is found guilty, sentenced to twelve years in prison. So begins a marriage neither Celestial nor Roy envisioned. They communicate through letters and short visits. Andre provides comfort to Celestial and a shoulder to lean on, while Roy begins an unlikely friendship in prison. Family members fight for justice, while others fight against disease, all with the hope of seeing Roy released.</p>
<p>But as the years pass by, it’s harder and harder to feel the love they once had. Roy begins his life inside the prison walls, while Celestial learns to live with their situation, finding success she never saw before. When Roy is released early because he was wrongfully convicted, can their marriage be the same as before? If it can&rsquo;t, can a new type of marriage be saved?</p>
<p>There is a reason this made it to Oprah’s book club. In fact, if they ever made this into a movie, Oprah should play one of the mothers. An American Marriage is a well-written story about injustice, perseverance, and learning to move on. As Celestial and Roy come to turns with Roy’s sentence, each must decide what their marriage means, and if they feel the same way, years later.</p>
<p>From the minute I picked up this book, it moved at a pace that kept me reading. Throughout the novel, Jones switches between narratives, told by Celestial, Roy or Andre, and letters between Celestial and Roy. While this seems like it would not be a smooth story, the flip-flopping works, and Jones manages to not miss a single detail. In this case, the different narratives enhance the story line. </p>
<p>That’s just it. An American Marriage is beautifully written. Whether you like the plot or not, there is no denying the writing quality. I did enjoy the plot so this read gets two thumbs up from me. Overall, a well-written, quality story paints the picture of an American marriage and if love between two people can withstand injustice. </p>
<p>As I get closer and closer to the end of the year, I find that reading has become more of an escape to me than it did earlier in the year. Maybe it’s because I have picked up the pace. It could be the escape after a long, not so great day at work. Or the escape from a screen to which I feel such an attachment. Or an escape from this crazy world we live in. This would provided an escape to a situation unfortunately, people find themselves in.</p>
<p>Anyway. Less than three months to go, 15 more books to read. Game on. </p>
