<p>We all know 2020 is a weird year. Well, weird is one way to put it. I’m sure it will only continue that way in the next six weeks as we round out the year. It only seems fitting that my 52nd read of the year is also a bit weird.</p>

<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-People-Novel-Fredrik-Backman/dp/1501160834/ref=sr_1_1?crid=DNQJD4P6IWPR&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=anxious+people&amp;qid=1605618668&amp;sprefix=anxi%2Caps%2C162&amp;sr=8-1">Anxious People</a></em><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Fredrik Backman<br>
<strong>2020 Book Count:</strong> 52</p>
<hr>
<p>Fredrik Backman’s newest novel is a story about a bank robbery. It’s also a story about a hostage situation, a love story, a story about sons and fathers, a story about a bridge, but mostly, it’s a story about idiots.</p>
<p>On December 30th, eight strangers are in a for-sale apartment for the viewing. Then a person wearing a ski mask, holding a pistol, walks in. So begins a story of the worst group of hostages ever.</p>
<p>As the day continues, nine strangers (now counting the bank robber) will dig deep, working through their issues individually and with the help of others. Each has their own secret, and each is not who they seem to be. Intertwined with these nine strangers are the stories of two policemen and one psychologist. Fate has somehow brought these people together, connecting them in a mysterious, funny, and idiotic way.</p>
<p>Told through present day events, the past, and police interviews, Backman tells a story about how a good person can make a bad, idiotic, decision. Then again, at some point, everyone of us has been an idiot, and sometimes, good things happen after those idiotic decisions have been made.</p>
<hr>
<p>At first, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to read this one. When I read that Fredrik Backman had a new novel, I looked into it on Amazon. At first glance, the description didn’t appeal to me. I even told my sister I didn’t think I’d read it. Then, I forgot I said I didn’t want to read it, and bought it anyway. I’m glad I did.</p>
<p><em>Anxious People</em>, like 2020, is odd. It was a good odd. Frankly, the book went in a lot of different directions. First, you think you have figured out the bank robber and the background story, then BAM! Things flip flop and Backman gives you more clues to what the truth is. It’s confusing and fun, all in one.</p>
<p>This novel was sad, funny, comforting and engrossing. You’ll be questioning the truth the entire way, but in a good way. I found myself wanting to know more, rather than being annoyed I was being tricked part of the time. I became invested in each character and their outcomes; each had a unique story, and I was rooting for every single one of them.</p>
<p><em>Anxious People</em> is not your typical novel. Then again, Backman’s books usually aren’t. That’s what makes them great. Everytime I pick up one of his novels, I enjoy it. I have yet to read one I didn’t care for; so next time I see that Backman has a new novel, I won’t doubt it. If <em>Anxious People</em> proves anything, it’s that Backman has yet to let me down.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Next Read:</strong> <em>Party of Two</em>* by Jasmine Guillory</p>
<p>*I’m reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire at the moment, but Party of Two will be my next post. Stay tuned!</p>
