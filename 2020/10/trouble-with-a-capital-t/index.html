<p>I’ve spent the last few weeks rereading the first two books of the <em>Paradise</em> series by Elin Hilderbrand before picking up the third one. For the past two years, she has put out one book a year and I’ve read them (see <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/12/class-dismissed">this</a> and <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2019/12/paradise-by-the-dashboard-light/">this</a>). I usually just pick up the latest book and start reading, but this time I thought to myself: “Pause. Reread the first two books.” So I did before picking up the third and final book, which arrived from Amazon in early October.</p>

<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Troubles-Paradise-3-Elin-Hilderbrand/dp/0316435589/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3JAKBG7IDK31D&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=troubles+in+paradise+elin+hilderbrand&amp;qid=1603113266&amp;sprefix=troubles+in%2Caps%2C231&amp;sr=8-1">Troubles in Paradise </a></em><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Elin Hilderbrand<br>
<strong>2020 Book Count:</strong> 50</p>
<hr>
<p>In the third and final book of the <em>Paradise</em> series, the Steele family is still trying to piece together exactly what happened on New Year’s Day when Russ Steele and Rosie Small were killed in a helicopter crash. The FBI is also trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>As each member of the Steele family travels back to St. John, with plans to live there, secrets will continue to be revealed. Irene Steele has agreed to be the mate on Huck’s (Rosie’s stepfather) fishing boat; Cash and Baker have each found a job that will keep them on the island. Rosie’s best friend, Ayers, seems to be on an emotional roller coaster, and Maia is working her way through the pre-teen / teen years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the island is watching the drama unfold as a storm is approaching. All are wondering - what happened on New Year’s Day?</p>
<p>They may soon find out.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was excited to finish reading the <em>Paradise</em> series to see the outcome; so much so, that I pre-ordered this book so it arrived on the first day it was available. It arrived on time, but I didn’t pick it up until I reread the first two books. I needed to refresh my memory because there have been a lot of books read in between.</p>
<p>I was disappointed in Hilderbrand’s last <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/10/see-you-next-year/">book</a>, and was worried that I would feel the same about <em>Troubles in Paradise</em>. The one thing that weighed in its favor was that I had to know how the series ended. Luckily, I wasn’t disappointed. Could it have been better? Yes. Could it have been worse? Yes (it could have been 28 Summers).</p>
<p>The good news is that most storylines were concluded, the book had drama and humor, and it was a quick read. I also liked that Hilderbrand added a perspective of St. John. The bad news is I still have several questions about what happens to a few characters (I’m talking about you Cash and Baker). Yes, their stories ended, but there are still some open ended questions. I need to know the answers! Also, the ending was a bit rushed. Somehow, while the previous books covered a short period of time, this one covered months. It felt like things were missing.</p>
<p>While I didn’t enjoy this series as much as I enjoyed the <em>Winter Street</em> series, Hilderbrand wrapped her first series that took her away from Nantucket for the first time in a fitting manner. I found myself not minding the flaws, and just enjoyed the read.</p>
<p>Of course, make sure you read the first two books before picking up <em>Troubles in Paradise</em>. The series as a whole won’t be the best series you ever read, but it will entertain you and you’ll find yourself continuing to read until you find out the truth.</p>
