<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decent-Proposal-Novel-Kemper-Donovan/dp/0062391593/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1551573886&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Decent Proposal</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Kemper Donovan<br>
<strong>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition:</strong> 7</p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>The Decent Proposal</em>, two strangers are given an interesting proposal - if they spend 2 hours a week together for the next year, they’ll split a million dollars. How could you say no?</p>
<p>Richard Baumbach is down on his luck as a struggling Hollywood producer. He spends his days drinking coffee, and his nights out with his best friend Mike (full name Michaela - important to note). Richard is an optimist who thinks this money could change things.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Santiago puts in more billable hours than anyone else in the office. Although usually quiet and a lone wolf, she could use the money to help her new friend, a homeless man with a tough past.</p>
<p>So it begins, in the form of a book and movie club, two hours a week together. Why them? They still don’t know. A friendship forms, and after their benefactor wants to meet, realizations may just be made.</p>
<p>Add in a jealous best friend, a concerned friend, a few less billable hours, a connection no one could predict, and you have <em>The Decent Proposal</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>In his debut novel, Donovan has a winner that is charming, heartfelt, and funny. The mystery of why Richard and Elizabeth were brought together will keep you reading. Although at some point, you start guessing. But Donovan really keeps the mystery up until the end.</p>
<p>While slow moving at points, the book does pick up and is a fairly easy read. Donovan brings together an interesting cast of characters, develops each with their own backstory, and gives you the opportunity to get to know all of them, not just Elizabeth and Richard. You’ll be rooting for them all along the way.</p>
<p>There are times when the B&amp;N bargain finds section lets me down. In this case, it was a successful trip that lead to a book that was well worth the read.</p>
