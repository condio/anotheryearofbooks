    <p>I actually started reading this book before I picked up The Christmas Star. I was only 10 pages or so into this one when I set it back down.

<p>Book Read:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Going-Dutch-Novel-James-Gregor/dp/1982103191/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=going+dutch&amp;qid=1578017123&amp;sr=8-1">Going Dutch</a></p>
<p>Author: James Gregor</p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 51</p>
<p>Richard is a graduate student, who is facing serious writer’s block. He can’t seem to write anything, not a single word. He is also exhausted by the gay dating scene in New York City, after trying app after app, site after site. Despite being surrounded by friends, Richard is also incredibly lonely.</p>
<p>Then, his classmate, Anne, steps in. She is at the top of the class, and is brilliant. Anne offers her help with his writer&rsquo;s block; she expects companionship in return, despite Richard being gay. A friendship is formed, which eventually evolves into something more. </p>
<p>After Richard matches with Blake online and has a so-so first date (pre-Anne), they meet again. Richard begins to split his time - dates with Richard, whatever he is doing with Anne. Neither know about the other. As each relationship moves forward, Richard finds himself at a crossroads. And at a crossroads, decisions need to be made. Something Richard struggles with constantly. But the time will come, as it always does.</p>
<p>I tried my best to describe what happens in this book, because honestly, it’s not the easiest to summarize. I’m still not completely sure what actually went on in this book. All I know is that I liked it much more than I thought I would. </p>
<p>I was skeptical for the first few chapters because I couldn’t stand Richard. He was having someone else write his papers - what is up with that? He seemed to be whining constantly, and genuinely seemed like a terrible person. But as the chapters went on, I kept reading because I wanted to know what would happen. Would Richard make a decision? What decision was that? What is actually going on here?</p>
<p>Again, I am still not sure what the point of this book was, and I’m sure there is something psychological to it. Gregor’s writing was excellent; he made me have a love-hate relationship with Richard on every page. He made me feel pity for Anne, yet want to smack sense into her all at once (or just smack her - I&rsquo;m still not sure). It was an interesting set of feelings. </p>
<p>I’m not sure that this will make you want to read Going Dutch or not, but give it a try. There’s a reason it’s getting such good reviews.</p>
<p>That marks book number 51 of 2019. I spent the last six days of 2019 doing nothing but reading, so my writing is a little behind. Stay tuned to see if I made it through number 52 before we started a new decade. </p>
<p>&hellip;I forgot to take a picture of <em>Going Dutch</em> before I returned it to the library, so please enjoy this picture of Canterbury in its place.</p>
