<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Royals-Katharine-McGee/dp/1984830201/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=american+royals&amp;qid=1589759963&amp;sr=8-1">American Royals</a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Katherine McGee<br>
<strong>2020 Book Count:</strong> 21</p>

<p>What would America look like if, instead of starting a democracy after the Revolutionary War, the country asked George Washington to be its king? <em>American Royals</em> is that story.</p>
<p>Centuries later, the Washingtons still reign, and eldest daughter Beatrice will, at some point, become the first queen regnant in the country’s history. She has been preparing for the role her entire life, with etiquette teachers, cabinet meetings and lessons from her father. Beatrice is expected to marry prior to becoming a queen, and marrying a commoner is not an option. In fact, suitors have been hand picked by her parents. As it continues to get closer and closer, Beatrice is starting to wonder if the duty is worth what she stands to lose.</p>
<p>Beatrice’s younger siblings, Samantha and Jefferson, have always had a little more leeway as they are the “spares.” Every monarchy needs a back up plan. Samantha rebels because of it. After she meets a handsome guy, who ends up being completely off limits to her, Samantha finds herself in unmarked territory in her love life, as well as with her family and closest friend.</p>
<p>The story is also told from the perspective of Nina, Samantha’s best friend who is a commoner with no title, and Daphne, Jefferson’s ex-girlfriend who believes it is her destiny to be a princess no matter who she has to take down. Suddenly, the two very different girls find themselves in a bit of a triangle with Jefferson.</p>
<p>Four young women; four different perspectives; one ultimate crown and a few broken hearts along the way make up <em>American Royals</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Technically, this book falls into the “young adult” category. That’s never stopped me from reading a book that I was interested in before, and it didn’t for this one either obviously. Honestly, the synopsis just sounded too good when I first read it.</p>
<p>At first, I was skeptical about having the points of view from four different women; however, it moved smoothly and didn’t cause any gaps in the story. It actually provided more information by including more than one perspective. Each protagonist had character development, which I was hoping for as I started reading.</p>
<p>I’m rooting for Beatrice and a particular outcome in the sequel; Nina seems like she could use a hug but also a little courage. Samantha is finding her voice and role, and I’m hoping there is more of her in the next book. Samantha’s story left me feeling like something is missing - it was the only one that I wished for more background, more details, more something. There, of course, will be people you want to smack most of the time - I’m talking to you, Daphne.</p>
<p>It’s hard to think about what an American monarchy would look like; but McGee makes me wonder. She sucked me into the drama, laughs and the story of the <em>American Royals</em>.</p>
<p>When I first started reading this, I did not realize this was going to be the first book in a series. While, yes, I could see the end coming, I have no idea what is going to happen in the sequel. McGee left me wanting more, which means, in my book, <em>American Royals</em> was a great read. I’m looking forward to the next book once it is released in August.</p>
