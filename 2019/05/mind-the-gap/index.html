    <p>AYOB has been MIA as my boyfriend, Matt, and I traveled to London and Paris for a vacation. While away, we took in historical sights, watched the Eiffel Tower&rsquo;s 130th Anniversary light show, walked 124 total miles, and ate a lot of pastries. I mean a lot of pastries. Along the way, we found a bookshop in each city, each with its own uniqueness and fame (I might have picked up a book or two).</p>
<p>Depending on the trip, reading can be difficult when traveling. Luckily for me, two train rides and sitting in the airport helped. Over the course of our trip, three books were consumed (well, the third I finished the day after we got home). So in this post, it’s three-for-one day! (Be warned, this post is longer than all others.)</p>

<p>Connell and Marianne act like they don’t know each other in public, but Connell’s mother works for Marianne’s family. One day after school, their paths officially cross. A connection begins, one that will move with them to college in Dublin, through other relationships and emotions, and out of college, into the real world.</p>
<p>As Connell and Marianne navigate their early twenties, Rooney tells a story of two people each moving in different directions. He is looking for meaning, she is starting to self destruct. But a pull keeps bringing them back, leaving you wonder if one will always be there for the other.</p>
<p>This book had intriguing reviews, and Rooney is said to be the next great writer between this novel and Conversations with Friends (T-Swift likes that one).  At times, this book seemed to drag, and I wanted to smack sense into both Connell and Marianne. But overall, it was a worthy read, as it had depth, character growth, and relatability. Adjusting to the no quotations style did take some time, and did take away from the story.</p>
<p>Would I recommend this one? Yes. Would I warn you it’s a little odd? Also yes.</p>

<p>Author: Julia Sonneborn</p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 18</p>
<p>Based on Jane Austen’s Persuasion, Sonneborn writes about Anne Corey, an English professor hoping for tenure. Then, her ex-fiancé, Adam, is named as the new president. Anne has a book to write, but the distractions are plenty. Romance awaits when a famous writer begins his residency. But this famous writer may have a few secrets, and Adam might have some unfinished business he&rsquo;d like to discuss. Will a second chance await Anne and Adam? Or will a famous writer have a different plan in mind?</p>
<p>Is this the greatest book you will ever read? No. Will it pass the time? Yes. It moves along well but wraps up a little too quickly. All of the sudden, bam! An ending when you could keep reading. Sonneborn modernizes Austen in this novel, and you can tell as it does not feel original. Overall, a quick, light read that will pass the train ride.</p>

<p>Author: Anne Griffin</p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 19</p>
<p>Maurice Hannigan is sitting at a bar, at a fancy hotel, with a single key in his pocket, ready to remember.</p>
<p>The eighty-four year old has five toasts to make before the night is over. Five toasts to five people who impacted his life, all in both good ways and bad, all with a drink specifically chosen for the person he is toasting. With each toast, Maurice tells more and more of his life story. He talks of a coin, of tragedy, of wealth, of endurance, and a love that has stayed with him. But at the end of the five toasts, Maurice has an appointment that he intends to keep.</p>
<p>I had mixed feelings about this debut novel. You know how this will end pretty much from the get-go, but yet, you keep reading. This book, despite being only 202 pages long, felt much, much longer. At times, Maurice’s story seemed to drag, then you’d read the next toast and you would want to keep reading. This book truly sent some mixed messages. But it will make you wonder about the question posed on the inside of the book cover: “If you had to pick five people to sum up your life, who would they be? If you were to raise a glass to each of them, what would you say? And what would you learn about yourself, when all is said?”</p>
<p>I read the last two books via the Nook app, since packing an iPad was easier than a few books. Since I don’t have any pictures of them in fancy places like Normal People, I thought I’d share a couple of the trip instead&hellip;</p>
