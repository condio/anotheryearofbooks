    <p>I was supposed to pick a happier book to read for number 40. After all the suspenseful, slightly disturbing reads, my boyfriend told me it would be a good idea. This read has a happy ending but is pretty socially relevant all at the same time.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-We-Ever-Wanted-Novel/dp/0399178929"><em>All We Ever Wanted</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Emily Giffin<br>
<strong>Number of Books Read:</strong> 40</p>
<hr>
<p>Emily Giffin’s latest novel is written in the point of view of three people - Nina, whose son has done something really stupid, Tom, whose daughter is impacted by this stupidity, and Lyla, who just wants to get through high school.</p>
<p>Nina has a great life - her husband made a fortune selling a company and they are now in the Nashville elite. Her son, Finch, is headed to Princeton in the fall and Nina worried what their life is doing to him.</p>
<p>Then comes the picture, taken on a drunken night and feature someone who didn’t know it was being taken. And several lives will never be the same.</p>
<p>Tom makes ends meet as a single parent and is, deservedly, pissed off when a picture of Lyla starts circulating. Lyla wants the whole thing to go away. Three lives becomes intertwined, as a father wants justice, a daughter learns the truth, and a mother wishes more for her son.</p>
<p>Add a few lies, some conniving, true friends, and a realization that there’s still time to change and you’ve got <em>All We Ever Wanted</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve read almost all of Giffin’s novels. They’re always good reads (see <em>Something Borrowed</em> and <em>Something Blue</em>). This is one is a little different than Giffin’s other novels, that always end with a feel good, everyone is better off, feeling. This book has people you can truly hate (although I did hate Darcy in <em>Something Blue</em> for a period of time), it’s relatable, and socially relevant.</p>
<p>Overall, Giffin’s latest novel will keep you reading, wondering if some people will ever grow up, and hoping that the bad guy sees some justice. Fingers crossed.</p>
<p>On another note: still waiting for them to make Something Blue into a movie. Can’t leave us hanging with only <em>Something Borrowed</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Next Read:</strong> <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> by Celeste Ng</p>
