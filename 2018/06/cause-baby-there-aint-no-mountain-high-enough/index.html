    <p>But maybe, there actually is? The Beaver library’s annual book sale came in for the win again when I found the next read just lying around, waiting to be purchased (along with about 8 others that filled my bag). I’m a big believer in reading the book before you see the movie based on it (did it in reverse for The Notebook and we all know that movie is fantastic). So when I found this next read, I had to buy it.</p>
<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Between-Us-Movie-Tie/dp/1524763225/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529714354&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=the+mountain+between+us"><em><strong>The Mountain Between Us</strong></em></a><br>
<strong>Author</strong>: Charles Martin<br>
<strong>Number of Books Read</strong>: 28</p>
<p>Imagine you were stranded on a mountain with one other person, a dog, and no civilization in sight. What would you do? Me, I’d scream to the high heavens, cry and probably just start running (don’t think it would end well for me). Dr. Ben Payne, however, is a determined man with hiking and camping experience, and he’s set on getting Ashley to her wedding.</p>
<p>That may prove to be difficult as Ashley is injured and can’t do much for herself, it’s the dead of winter on a mountain in Utah, and no fight plans indicate that they were on a plane heading to Salt Lake City. Ben sees only one option and that’s survival. Using his camping gear and aptitude for the outdoors, Ben begins the weeks long journey to survival.</p>
<p>Ben is also a broken man, who uses a recorder to talk to his wife, with whom he is separated. He doesn’t open up much, but neither does Ashley who is getting married just because she’s comfortable. He promises to not leave her behind despite her pleading at times, because one cannot survive without the other. Plus he’s not looking at her memory every time he closes his eyes.</p>
<p>Enter encounters with moose, makeshift medical gear, the stories Ben tells back to his wife, and a dog no one can remember the name of, and you’ve got <em>The Mountain Between Us.</em></p>
<p>Will Ben keep his promise and get both Ashley and himself back into civilization? Will he open up about what happened between him and his wife? Will Ashley get to walk down the aisle?</p>
<p>Frankly, I couldn’t put this book down. Luckily when I was reading it on the bus, most days there were traffic. I finally read some before falling asleep which I haven’t done in awhile. Some reviews of this book say that it’s “eh.” At times, yes, things seem completely implausible, but what do I know about surviving in the mountains for weeks? Martin could be telling nothing but the truth.</p>
<p>Plus, I will always recommend a book where for 90% of the book, I was predicting the wrong ending. Plot twists: they are a favorite of mine.</p>
<p>My mom tells me the movie is pretty good. I told her I was concerned the movie would end differently than the book. Now, I’m not so sure I’ll be right. Another good thing, right?</p>
<p>Next Read: <em>The Glass Castle</em> by Jeannette Wells</p>
