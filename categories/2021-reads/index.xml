&lt;p&gt;The first AYOB post of 2021 is finally here! I spent some time at the very end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 reading &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; before digging into the first official book of 2021. I decided, after conferring with Matt, that to be counted towards the 2021 read count, the book must be completely finished during 2021. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; spanned two years, so it won’t count towards either read count; however, this next read will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado… the first official read of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
