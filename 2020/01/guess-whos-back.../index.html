    <p>It’s Another Year of Books! I seem to have a trend when it comes to my first book of the year (or within the first 3). I always seem to start with an autobiography or memoir. In 2018, Anna Faris’s <a href="https://www.anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/01/anna-faris-is-in-fact-qualified.html"><em>Unqualified</em></a> was number 3; in 2019, Michelle Obama’s <a href="https://www.anotheryearofbooks.com/2019/01/2019-is-becoming-good-one.html"><em>Becoming</em></a> was the first read.</p>
<p>2020 is no different.</p>

<strong>Author:</strong> Elton John<br>

<p>We all know Elton John. If you don’t know his name, I’m sure you know his music. If you don’t know either, shame on you - go look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo1OwRTRKRk">Bennie and the Jets</a>. Then, you may come back and continue reading this post. </p>
<p>In <em>Me</em>, Sir Elton John takes readers on a journey from his childhood, to his meeting Bernie Taupin after they both answered an ad, to his drug and alcohol addiction, to meeting his husband, and to now. </p>
<p>He talks of his struggle to make it, and of years of backing other singers until his writing career took off. Then, Elton John is born (quite literally, as he changed his name), and the world has never been the same. </p>
<p><em>Me</em> is the story of Elton John, told directly from the man himself. It’s a story and a life full of drama, but rooted in a need to be heard and seen. It’s a story you should read.</p>
<hr>
<p>It always takes me awhile to get through memoirs or autobiographies. It’s not because they aren’t good reads; it just seems to take more thought. That happened with this one as well.</p>
<p>Despite it taking me ten days to read this, boy, did I enjoy it. It was open, honest, serious and funny all at once. Elton John discusses his drug and alcohol addictions, his difficult family life, and his friendships, both with other famous people and the ordinary folk. He also discusses his relationship with his husband, David and fatherhood, including how both have changed him, and ultimately keep him clean.</p>
<p>His stories of how working on the music of <em>The Lion King</em> and <em>Billy Elliot</em> made me smile - I love both! I also enjoyed reading of his friendships with John Lennon, Freddie Mercury, and Gianni Versace, as well as his relationship with Bernie. His story of how Bernie traveled all the way to France to complain about how much he hated one of the albums made me chuckle. Elton John’s friendship with Ryan White, a young boy who had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion, and his mother will move you, and give you insight into why his AIDS foundation is so important. </p>
<p>When I say this book has honesty, I mean <strong>HONESTY</strong>. You’ll read about a dinner where Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere almost got into a fist fight over Princess Diana; he talks about a tour with Tina Turner that never saw the light of day because she was a “terror” (don’t worry they made up). He’ll even talk about peeing himself on stage, following the removal of his prostate. Now, tell me that isn’t honesty.</p>
<p>Whether you like his music or not, <em>Me</em> is a worthy read, full of character, sass and honesty. Add it to your “to read” list for 2020. </p>
