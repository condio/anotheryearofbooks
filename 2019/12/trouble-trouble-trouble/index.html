<p>Author: Taffy Brodesser-Akner</p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 48</p>
<p>Toby Fleishman became a ladies’ man after his wife finally agreed to his requested divorce. He spends his time flirting on apps, and seeing woman after woman. He embraced his changing schedule with his children - enjoying every minute of the limited time they had together. But, Toby could not predict his wife Rachel would drop the kids off one morning, didn&rsquo;t pick them up when expected, and did not return again.</p>
<p>As Toby tries to navigate Rachel’s sudden departure, while trying to figure out where she went and if she was okay, he must also juggle patients and fellows. Toby must also figure out how to be a single full time parent while also embracing his new sexual freedom. In between all of that, he is trying to figure out where his marriage went wrong.</p>
<p>Told from the point of view of Toby’s friend Libby, the book is split into three parts, each focusing on a certain time in the summer months. As Toby has rekindled his friendship with Libby and their friend Seth, the story focuses on his friends’ lives as well, as they get together after many years apart. </p>
<p>Add in a few dating apps, a serious case at the hospital, a chance at a promotion, and an ending you didn’t see coming (well, at one point you may guess), and you’ve got Fleishman is In Trouble. </p>
<p>I can’t say I loved this one. I can’t say I hated it. But I will say, I’m glad I didn’t buy it and instead got it from the library. It would have been a waste of my money. It took me over a week to read. That alone is a bad sign; I just couldn’t get myself to pick it up some days. Instead, it just sat next to me on the table. </p>
<p>At first, Toby Fleishman seemed a bit whiny. Yes, he had reasons to complain (like his almost ex wife dropping the kids off then dropping off of the face of the earth). But, he also didn’t seem to take responsibility. He always pointed the finger elsewhere and it’s hard to like a character like that. </p>
<p>Brodesser-Akner’s style was different than most other authors’. The book was divided, as mentioned, into three sections, none of which had a chapter. I admit, there is such a thing as too many chapters. With the exception of Brooklyn, books like this one never go well for me. I struggle to find a stopping point or a natural break. A chapter gives me that, and after this three sectioned book, I’m grateful for chapters.</p>
<p>This book has already been named one of the top books of the year by a good amount of newspapers and magazines. Clearly, they did not ask for my opinion. If you are looking for a slower, more drawn out read that has a pretty good reputation, this may be a good one for you. Good luck with the no chapters.</p>
