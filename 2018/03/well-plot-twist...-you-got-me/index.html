<p>Niru’s parents are conservative Nigerians, who came to the US hoping to give the family a better life. In fact, his mother told his father if they stayed in Nigeria, she wouldn&rsquo;t have married him. OJ, Niru’s older brother is the prodigal son. He&rsquo;s going to be a doctor, he does everything right. A senior in high school, Niru is headed to Harvard with medical school in his future. But Niru has a secret that his conservative, religious parents will not accept.</p>
<p>His best friend Meredith is the only one who knows. She finds out after she tries to kiss him. For all the times people have asked why he doesn’t sleep with her, date her or “tap that,” Niru has been hiding that he is gay, because he knows how is parents will react.</p>
<p>He is right. His parents’ reaction is brutal. He is taken to Nigeria for a religious intervention and returns having to be “cured.” While this is happening, Niru is learning to be himself, opens up to a guy whom he really likes. But the pressure from his parents is always in his mind.</p>
<p>Meredith has her own issues: not getting into a school she wanted, left alone by her inattentive parents. Then an instant changes both of their lives, and Meredith begins to tell her story.</p>
<p>Iweala writes about a problem that is, sadly, still real and relevant. He writes in a way that puts you right next to Niru, experiencing life with him. You feel how torn he is between who his parents want to be and who is his.</p>
<p>Then comes the plot twist I never saw coming. A plot twist that involves a situation that is also real and we’ve all heard about in the news. Iweala explains so much about current times in this page turning book.</p>
<p>An interesting fact: Iweala doesn’t use quotation marks for dialogue. The paragraphs just flow, making me wonder if all of his novels are written in this way.</p>
