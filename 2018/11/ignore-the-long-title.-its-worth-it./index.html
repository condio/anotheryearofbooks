    <p>It’s becoming more and more difficult to pick which book I read. Since I’m on the last leg of 52 for the year, I feel as if I should make sure they are good ones (PS - this one worked out in my favor). But my time for reading 52 this year is quickly dwindling. I feel like I woke up one morning and it was Halloween, and the next thing I knew I was figuring out what I’m doing on Turkey Day. This time of year always flies by, but I think this year, adding in a busy work schedule, building Ikea furniture, and the billion (feels like it anyway) of things there are to do, it’s going even faster.</p>
<p>But, there is always time for a good book. So away we go.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guernsey-Literary-Potato-Peel-Society/dp/0385341008/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1542549895&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+guernsey+literary+and+potato+peel+pie+society+a+novel"><em>The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society</em></a><br>
<strong>Authors:</strong> Mary Ann Shaffer &amp; Annie Barrows<br>
<strong>Number of Books Read:</strong> 48</p>
<hr>
<p>Juliet Ashton became a writer during World War II, when her articles as Izzy Bickerstaff were published as a novel. As she embarks on a literary tour, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, a resident of Guernsey, part of the Channel Islands, after he has found a book previously owned by Juliet.</p>
<p>Residents of Guernsey formed the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society on a whim - a few of them were caught when late for curfew by the Germans, and Elizabeth created a book club. As Juliet begins corresponding with other residents of Guernsey, she learns of their lives during the German occupation, and their limited knowledge of the outside world.</p>
<p>Juliet then travels to Guernsey to learn more as she believes they would be a great subject for the book she has been struggling to write. She is instantly smitten with them as they are with her. There she meets Isola, who is eager, Dawsey, who is quiet and attentive, and Amelia who is the matriarch figure, as well as many others. Through them, she learns of their lives, as well as the story of Elizabeth, who was sent to a concentration camp, and was the embodiment of them all.</p>
<p>Add in a few jealous men, a young girl who is being raised by a town, and a temptation to stay on Guernsey, and you’ve got <em>The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Genuinely, I completely enjoyed this novel. I have no complaints about it. Written completely as letters, the story never has a plot hole. You never felt as if you missed a step, with the letters being written in such detail.</p>
<p>There was not a single character that seemed out of place. Each and everyone, whether they wrote a letter, or were mentioned in passing, had a place in the story. Juliet was genuine and funny, and pulls you into the book. Also, you’ll find yourself rooting for Dawsey, who seems like a top notch guy.</p>
<p>I learned after finding this book at the library that this was also made into a movie by Netflix (given away by the sticker on the cover). So of course, I could not watch it until I finished the book (my cardinal rule, remember?). So I’ll end here. I’ve got a movie to watch.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Next Read:</strong> <em>The Greatest Love Story Ever Told</em> by Megan Mullally &amp; Nick Offerman</p>
