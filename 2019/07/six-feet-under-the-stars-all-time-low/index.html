    <p>It is hot outside. Unbearably hot, which means I usually get slightly sun burnt on any walks/runs, and come back to work sweating from my lunchtime walk. It’s super fun, let me tell you.

<p>Book Read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Will-Only-Hurt-Little/dp/1501184717/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ZS99YCZBQB0R&amp;keywords=this+will+only+hurt+a+little+busy+phillips&amp;qid=1562507075&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=this+wi%2Caps%2C158&amp;sr=8-1">This Will Only Hurt a Little</a></p>
<p>Author: Busy Philipps </p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 23</p>
<p>Busy Philipps has quite a life. From leaving the house naked at age 2, to dislocating a kneecap at a seventh grade dance, to refusing a sex scene because she was a breastfeeding mom, Philipps has many stories to tell.</p>
<p>In chapters titled with song lyrics, Philipps writes about her teenage years, dealing with catty friends and crappy “boyfriends.” She also speaks publicly for the first time about several experiences, that until years later, she never fully grasped. Philipps writes about famous friends that she has gained along the way, from clicking instantly with Michelle Williams (becoming her award show date). She talks of her experiences on Freaks and Geeks, ER, and Dawson’s Creek. Philipps also writes about using Instagram stories to up her game..</p>
<p>Philipps talks about the ups and downs of show business, and the impact of it on family life. With wit and humor, she opens up, telling readers intimate stories of her life, including some they don’t see coming. Add in some that are pretty hysterical, and you’ve got This Will Only Hurt a Little. </p>
<p>This book was awesome. That’s it. Well, it had a few too many name drops, but still, it was awesome. That’s the only description you’ll get from me.</p>
<p>Just kidding - what kind of blog would that be? This book is candid, entertaining and honest. Philipps talks about her start on TV, and how at times, she and her family have been living paycheck to paycheck, waiting for the next big thing. She seems to hold nothing back in her writing, including a lot of names.</p>
<p>Philipps has no problem name dropping, for the good or the bad. The one downfall of this book - the name dropping. I don’t really need to know how on Dawson’s Creek, everyone really only cared about Katie Holmes.</p>
<p>Philipps calls out body shaming on sets, specific actors and producers, and comments on more recent events. She discusses how she and her husband worked their way out of divorce, and genuinely does not seem interested in withholding any information. </p>
<p>Once I picked this book up, I couldn’t put it down. I’ve found that celebrity memoirs are hit or miss for me. While I seem to be reading more and more, I always read them slower than other books. I have no clue why. While I slowly read this at the beginning, I hit a turning point and BAM! Picked up the pace.</p>
<p>Looking for an honest and entertaining celebrity memoir, then this one is for you. </p>

<p>Always fun to re-enact a cover shot!</p>
<p>Next Read: From the Corner of the Oval by Beck Dorey-Stein</p>
<p>PS&hellip;. I could not think of a good title for this post, so I picked a song my sister and I were just talking about. It seems to work?</p>
