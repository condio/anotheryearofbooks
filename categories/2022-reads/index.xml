      <description>And we are back! Briefly, but we’re back. It feels good to be here.
Now, I know it’s been a while - an entire year to be exact. I’m wondering if I’ll even remember how to write a post. Then after I write it, will I remember the steps to publish it? Good news - it looks like I did.
It’s been a year of no posts and no book photos.</description>
