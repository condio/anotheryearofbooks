    <p>Let me start with one note… I read this book in two day. Two days. Two days of wishing the bus ride was longer so I could keep reading, two days of reading before falling asleep (which I usually don’t do anymore), two days of a great read. And away we go&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Note-Played-Lisa-Genova/dp/147671780X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525049511&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=every+note+played+lisa+genova"><em>Every Note Played</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Lisa Genova<br>
<strong>Number of Books Read:</strong> 21</p>

<p>If the two days comment didn’t tell you I liked this book, I’m not sure what will. I initially found this one on the shelf at Target when I was out buying too much for the house my boyfriend and I are buying. I always stop by the book section at Target when shopping, because you never know what you’ll find. In this case, it was a good one.</p>
<p><em>Every Note Played</em> is the story of a famous concert pianist, Richard, who is diagnosed with ALS. For months, he was in denial and refused to accept his diagnosis, and for those months, he didn’t tell his estranged daughter or his ex-wife. Richard has always picked piano over his family. But he has lost feeling in his right hand, and he knows his left hand and everything else is coming next.</p>
<p>Karina divorced Richard years ago, but hasn’t been able to move on despite no ring being on her finger. She gave up her dreams of being a jazz pianist to follow Richard, and has been lost ever since. But fate has other plans, as Karina becomes Richard’s reluctant caregiver in his final months.</p>
<p>Richard has baggage, both with Karina and their daughter Grace. Grace knows where she stands in her father’s life, but comes to his side, sleeping next to him on the floor when he fell and she can’t get him up. Aided by friends and Bill, a home nurse who has become a confident, doctor and friend, Karina, Grace and Richard must navigate how the past needs to be corrected before it’s too late.</p>
<p>As he comes to turn with his illness, Karina comes to terms with who she was and who she is meant to be. Richard makes a decision, giving Karina the freedom he never got her during his marriage.</p>
<hr>
<p>Genova is a neuroscientist, who also wrote <em>Still Alice</em> (haven’t read that one yet, but I know Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her role). When reading, it is obvious she did thorough research before providing any facts. She follows Richard as his degree progresses with depth and you just know that she knows what she’s talking about. Some writers just have a way of sucking you into the story with their words. Genova is one of those people (remember – two days).</p>
<p><em>Every Note Played</em> is a story of loss, hope, acceptance, and learning to move on. Despite knowing how one person’s story will end, Genova’s words will keep you turning the page, emotion after emotion.</p>
