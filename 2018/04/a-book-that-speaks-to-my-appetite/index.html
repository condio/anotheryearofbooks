<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Plate-Special-Autobiography-Appetites/dp/0307951103/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522515922&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=blue+plate+special"><em>Blue Plate Special: An Autobiography of My Appetites</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Kate Christensen<br>
<strong>Number of Books Read:</strong> 17</p>
<hr>
<p>Kate Christensen has had a lot of experiences, all which shaped her life. She witnessed her father beating up her mother, she bounced from boyfriend to boyfriend looking for love in all the wrong places, one sister joined a cult, she was a nanny in France for a year before going to college and a molester got away with way too much, and how after years, she, her mother and sisters are closer than ever.</p>
<p>Throughout this story, she tells her life story. Within each story, she relates it back to food – how food impacted the situation, her memories of what she ate, how food impacted her relationships, and how some of the best ones began over a delicious meal. She remembers how even when they were struggling after leaving her father, her mother always fed the neighborhood kids. How she and her first husband cried over food when their marriage was over after struggling through therapy for years. How she stuck to diets but then reverted to binge eating when terrible things were happening, and learned to savor every bite.</p>
<p>Christensen writes about her struggle to find contentment within herself. For years, she forced herself to be happy in situations. Finally, through her journey of life and food, she finds that sometimes contentment is just what you need. Along with a good meal of course.</p>
<hr>
<p>Christensen’s novel was well written. At times it was heart-warming, then it was heart-breaking. You’ll be hoping all turns out well in the end for her, knowing that since she wrote it all down, there must be some light at the end of the tunnel. Either way, you&rsquo;ll keep turning the page, waiting to see where life took her next. </p>
<p>While at times, this book put me to sleep on the bus (I blame the work day because I really liked this book), it was a smooth, easy read. I laughed with Christensen, I didn’t cry but at times I was sad, but ultimately, I admired her honesty. Her honesty to write her deepest thoughts, her family’s stories, and how when she is writing, she never feels lonely. There’s a difference between being alone and being lonely; reading gives you a shot to avoid both. Pick up this one and experience the same. </p>
