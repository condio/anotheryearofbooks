<strong>Author:</strong> Rebecca Serle<br>

<hr>
<p>Dannie Kohan has a plan. In fact, she has a five year plan. When asked at an interview at her dream job, Dannie immediately knows the answer - she’ll be married to her boyfriend, be living in their favorite neighborhood in a house she envision, and be on her way to junior partner at her dream firm. To Dannie, the future is planned out.</p>
<p>On the night of her engagement, Dannie falls asleep, only to wake up in a completely different apartment, with a different ring on her finger, and a different man next to her. The date is exactly five years in the future. Although she only spends an hour there, Dannie can’t shake the feeling after she wakes up in the present day.</p>
<p>For years, Dannie continues to carry this unknown feeling. She never mentions the dream to anyone, including her fiance and life-long best friend, Bella. The only person she tells is her therapist. Bella has always been the constant in Dannie’s life, and vice versa. But despite this, Dannie can’t bring herself to bring it up, even when she meets someone from her dream hour.</p>
<p>For five years, Dannie has kept this secret. What will happen when the day approaches?</p>
<hr>
<p>This book was a Skimm read recommendation. I put it on my list and waited for the e-book to become available at the library. When it finally did, I read the book in three days.</p>
<p><em>In Five Years</em> is a love story, but it’s not a romance novel. It’s also not the love story you expect. That’s what I loved about it. When I first read the description, I expected it to be a rom-com of some sort. Yes, it has its moments, but it also has a serious side. It was much more serious than I thought it would be, which I found refreshing. This gave the book more depth than I expected, and was a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>My favorite parts of <em>In Five Years</em> were those that centered on Dannie’s and Bella’s lifelong friendship. They couldn’t be more different. Bella is a free spirit, while Dannie is the planner. Together, they compliment each other. Despite their opposite personalities at a young age, they bonded together for life, and they were honest and open with each other, no matter what was thrown at them. Dannie and Bella navigated life together as a pair.</p>
<p><em>In Five Years</em> is ultimately a story of true friendship. Yes, it does have its romantic comedy moments, but it’s a heck of a lot deeper than that.</p>
<p>What did Carrie Bradshaw say? &ldquo;Maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates&hellip;&rdquo; It might be true.</p>
