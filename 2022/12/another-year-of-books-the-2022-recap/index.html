    <p>And we are back! Briefly, but we’re back. It feels good to be here.</p>
<p>Now, I know it’s been a while - an entire year to be exact. I’m wondering if I’ll even remember how to write a post. Then after I write it, will I remember the steps to publish it? Good news - it looks like I did.</p>
<p>It’s been a year of no posts and no book photos. But, it’s been a year with a whole heck of a lot of reading. In complete honesty, I enjoyed the reprieve from feeling rushed to write down my thoughts on a book and get a post out there. It allowed me to read more books - and that’s exactly what I did.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="106-books-i-read-106-books-this-year">106 books. I read 106 books this year.</h3>
<hr>
<p>I know what you’re thinking - that’s nuts. I completely agree with you. Yet I couldn’t get myself to slow down. I just kept picking up book after book. The downfall, of course, is that reading so many books makes it tough to summarize them. Picking five top reads was pretty much impossible. I had to go back to my ratings on Goodreads to jog my memory.</p>
<p>It took some time, but I got myself together and gathered my thoughts. This is going to be a little lengthy - there were so many books I wanted to discuss.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here it is… the Annual Recap of Another Year of Books, 2022 Edition.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="lets-talk-about-bridgerton">Let’s Talk about Bridgerton</h3>
<p>While we eagerly await season 3, I decided it was time to finally read the books. Well, except one… I didn’t go back and read <em>The Duke and I</em>. I couldn’t get myself to; mostly, because I had seen the first season of the show and figured that summed it up. Then, I heard about <em>that</em> scene. If you know the books, you’ll know what I’m talking about. I decided to skip it for now - I may eventually give in. Who knows.</p>
<p>But the other books - loved most of them. The winners - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Was-Wicked-Epilogue-Bridgertons-ebook/dp/B00UG8RP9U/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2H8P1RNQV3SGN&amp;keywords=when+I+was+wicked&amp;qid=1672175059&amp;sprefix=when+i+was+wicked%2Caps%2C72&amp;sr=8-2"><em>When He Was Wicked</em></a>, aka Francesca’s book; and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UG8RP6S?ref_=dbs_p_pwh_rwt_anx_cl_1&amp;storeType=ebooks"><em>It’s in His Kiss</em></a>, aka Hyacinth’s story. The let downs - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U6SFUVK?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_4&amp;storeType=ebooks"><em>To Sir Phillip, With Love</em></a>, aka Eloise’s story; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UG8RP3G?ref_=dbs_p_pwh_rwt_anx_cl_3&amp;storeType=ebooks"><em>On the Way to the Wedding</em></a>, aka Gregory’s story, which was my least favorite. That leaves books <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UG8RP2W?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_2&amp;storeType=ebooks">3</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U6SFUVA?ref_=dbs_p_pwh_rwt_anx_cl_1&amp;storeType=ebooks">4</a> in the middle. But the best one was, hands down, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UG8RP22?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_1&amp;storeType=ebooks"><strong>The Viscount Who Loved Me</strong></a>, aka Anthony’s story. It was my favorite. I could read it over and over again and not be sick of it. Keep in mind it is different from the show, but that seemed to be by design. Either way, it is still the best.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="few-the-let-downs">Few The Let Downs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Life-Addie-LaRue-ebook/dp/B084357H23/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3I7JAILP0B0YS&amp;keywords=the+invisible+life+of+addie+larue&amp;qid=1672175369&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=the+invi%2Cdigital-text%2C87&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</strong></a> by V.E Schwab</p>
<p>I had such high hopes for this book. Everyone I’ve talked to said they liked it. I ended up feeling disappointed, mostly because the first 200 pages dragged. But that’s not promising when the book is 442 pages long. Overall, yes, I enjoyed this one, but it left me with a bad taste.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wish-You-Were-Here-Novel-ebook/dp/B0925DXNV1/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3WFWYG8G9D08&amp;keywords=wish+you+were+here+jodi+picoult&amp;qid=1672175522&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=wish+you+we%2Cdigital-text%2C79&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Wish You Were Here</strong></a> by Jodi Picoult</p>
<p>I was intrigued by the synopsis of this book, but then, like the others in this section, I had to force myself to keep going. There is a plot twist I didn’t anticipate in this one, but I was shocked to see it on some of the top book lists this year. I still don’t understand as I write this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paris-Apartment-Novel-Lucy-Foley-ebook/dp/B098QS47D3/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S2D2S3EC1Z&amp;keywords=the+paris+apartment+lucy+foley&amp;qid=1672175546&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=the+paris+ap%2Cdigital-text%2C67&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The Paris Apartment</strong></a> by Lucy Foley</p>
<p>This one had so much hype. But I could not get past the plot. It was - I don’t know, weird? Not only was something missing but there were definitely parts I was like, “I’m sorry, she did what?! And he did what?!” I spent 300 pages waiting for something to happen and then it happened then the book was over. I hear <em>The Guest List</em> is better. Check that one out instead.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="you-know-i-love-a-rom-com">You Know I Love a Rom-Com</h3>
<p>I feel like, at this point, this section needs no introduction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Roommate-Experiment-Novel-ebook/dp/B09Q9WSZ9G/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2G55P2AXATZCB&amp;keywords=the+american+roommate+experiment&amp;qid=1672176004&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=the+american%2Cdigital-text%2C75&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The American Roommate Experiement</strong></a> by Elena Armas</p>
<p>I was excited that Rosie, a fierce friend from <em>The Spanish Love Deception</em>, was getting her own book. She and Lucas, the main characters in this book, are lovable. The story is told from a double POV, which added something. It gave an insight into each character and played into the chemistry. This book had all the great features of a rom-com - fake dating, online crushes, tension, chemistry, laughs, spice, and a HEA.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Summer-After-Carley-Fortune-ebook/dp/B09CD83VVG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=9IEY022DA5GN&amp;keywords=every+summer+after&amp;qid=1672176116&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=every+summer%2Cdigital-text%2C72&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Every Summer After</strong></a> by Carley Fortune</p>
<p>In this debut novel, we meet Sam and Percy, childhood friends who became more only to fall apart. This one is told through alternating timelines, which plays in its favor. It puts the pieces together. While I figured out the big secret part way through, I wanted to keep reading. Sam and Percy were great - I was so invested in their “would they, wouldn’t they.” This rom-com is a story about first loves, family, friendship and romance. Here’s my plea for Charlie getting his own book! You’ll have to read this one to find out more about him.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Hypothesis-Ali-Hazelwood-ebook/dp/B08T6XN4FP/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2M0KOHRLRB4PR&amp;keywords=the+love+hypothesis&amp;qid=1672176129&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=the+love+h%2Cdigital-text%2C80&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The Love Hypothesis</strong></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Brain-Ali-Hazelwood-ebook/dp/B09PQFL2J7/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2M0KOHRLRB4PR&amp;keywords=the+love+hypothesis&amp;qid=1672176145&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=the+love+h%2Cdigital-text%2C80&amp;sr=1-4"><strong>Love on the Brain</strong></a> by Ali Hazelwood</p>
<p>At this point, I’ve read <em>The Love Hypothesis</em> twice. I first read it earlier this year and then reread it before <em>Love on the Brain</em> was released. I’ll admit I liked <em>The Love Hypothesis</em> a little more. There are a lot of similarities between the two books, but each is good on its own feet. Both feature women in STEM. I’m here for it. I liked the fake dating trope of <em>The Love Hypothesis</em> and the <em>You’ve Got Mail</em> vibes of <em>Love on the Brain</em>. Those separated these two some. Either way, I’m looking forward to what Ali Hazelwood does next.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-York-Minute-Kate-Spencer-ebook/dp/B09834992C/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1A8T2V2XSPZ2&amp;keywords=in+a+new+york+minute+by+kate+spencer&amp;qid=1672176161&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=in+a+new%2Cdigital-text%2C71&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>In a New York Minute</strong></a> by Kate Spencer</p>
<p>The only downfall of this book was it ended too quickly. The ending was slightly rushed, but I really enjoyed Franny and Hayes’ story. Their “meet cute” was funny. It was also mortifying to think about. Their continuing run-ins were increasingly cute. Ultimately, this book was fun. I enjoyed the pieces of NYC involved. I was excited that, despite this being categorized (by me) as a rom-com, Franny had a strong sense of self and strength.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-repeat-authors">The Repeat Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Jasmine Guillory</strong></p>
<p>It seems any time Jasmine Guillory puts out a new book, I can guarantee I’ll read it. This year found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Meant-be-Novel-ebook/dp/B09HNDHJLS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QDFSUTOY40PS&amp;keywords=by+the+book&amp;qid=1672175946&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=by+the+book%2Cdigital-text%2C86&amp;sr=1-1"><em>By the Book</em></a>, a retelling of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drunk-Love-Jasmine-Guillory-ebook/dp/B09QP9K4C4?ref_=ast_sto_dp"><em>Drunk On Love</em></a>, a standalone. While at first I was skeptical of <em>By the Book</em>, I got sucked in and read it in two days. It was great - the subtle hints of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> were well placed. It was never too in my face. I ended up really enjoying this one. <em>Drunk on Love</em> brought the spice. Margot and Luke balanced each other out; you could feel the tension coming off the page. It was flirty, funny and genuine. It was another two day read for me. Here’s to this being the first book in another series! I can’t wait to see what Guillory has planned for us next.</p>
<p><strong>Kristen Ashley</strong></p>
<p>Two more books in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QFTPQL1?binding=kindle_edition&amp;ref_=dbs_s_ks_series_rwt_tkin&amp;qid=1672176190&amp;sr=1-5"><em>River Rain</em></a> series were released this year, and I am on pins and needles waiting for the next one, scheduled for release in September 2023. She recently changed who the book will be about and I cannot wait. The two releases of 2022, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Taking-Leap-River-Rain-Novel-ebook/dp/B097699JK1/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NS8K84W4K9LE&amp;keywords=taking+the+leap&amp;qid=1672176218&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=taking+the+%2Cdigital-text%2C72&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Taking the Leap</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09QJ1D4RZ?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_3&amp;storeType=ebooks"><em>Making the Match</em></a>, were both great. I couldn’t put either down. The cast of characters spanning these books were great from the start, but each time new characters are added, I get excited for the next read. I like that Kristen Ashley tells stories of different age groups, different scenarios, and more. It’s never limited. September 2023 can’t come soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Jenkins Reid</strong></p>
<p>There’s something about TJR’s writing that sucks you in and makes you not want to come up for air. Besides her newest read (see #2 below), I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/After-Do-Taylor-Jenkins-Reid-ebook/dp/B00GEEB8UC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FED5JE220E8V&amp;keywords=after+i+do&amp;qid=1672176331&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=after+i+do%2Cdigital-text%2C67&amp;sr=1-1"><em>After I Do</em></a>, a straightforward, genuine book about what happens when love and a marriage begins to fall apart; I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Husbands-Evelyn-Hugo-Novel-ebook/dp/B01M5IJM2U?ref_=ast_sto_dp"><em>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo</em></a>. It does start off a little slowly (I mean, what can you expect with seven husbands), but once it picked up, it was like any other TJR book - a great one.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to win an advanced read copy of this book via Abby Jimenez’s newsletter. I was so excited! I then read this book in a single day. A DAY. It just didn’t feel right putting this in my Top 5 (it would have been) because it was an ARC. Since it is not due to be published until April 2023, I decided to give it a special mention here. In this follow up to <em>Part of Your World</em>, Dr. Briana Ortiz receives a letter from Dr. Jacob Maddox - an actual letter. She thought he was a jerk until he sent a letter. So begins an exchange of letters back and forth until Jacob offers Briana something she has been wishing for. Together, they bring the heat. Here, you’ll get a strong, patient, fierce, lovable female main character and a vulnerable, comforting, and loving male main character. You will definitely want to read this.</p>

<h3 id="the-memoir-you-need-to-read">The Memoir You Need to Read</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unprotected-Memoir-Billy-Porter-ebook/dp/B08WJTZ6C7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26RX2KXGJ86DV&amp;keywords=unprotected&amp;qid=1672176591&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=unpro%2Cdigital-text%2C78&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Unprotected</strong></a> by Billy Porter</p>
<p>I can still remember the feeling in the room after Billy Porter sang “Not My Father’s Son,” as Lola on the Pittsburgh run of <em>Kinky Boots</em>. He came back to the city especially for that part of the tour. I admired Billy Porter on that day, and I admire him even more after reading his memoir. He writes in a unique voice that is heart-breaking, vulnerable, open, and inspiring. You’ll read of his drive to keep going when the odds were completely against him; you’ll read of his “angels” who had such an impact on his life; you’ll hear his sass. This book is outstanding. Read it.</p>

<h3 id="and-finally-the-top-five-reads-of-2022">And Finally, The Top Five Reads of 2022:</h3>
<p>Because of the length of this post, I decided not to recap the plot of each of these books. Check out the links to read the synopsis of each book (and maybe buy a copy!).</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wedding-Veil-Kristy-Woodson-Harvey-ebook/dp/B09842KJMR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3OAVUC9W8FGMD&amp;keywords=the+wedding+veil+kristy+woodson+harvey&amp;qid=1672176651&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=the+wedding+ve%2Cdigital-text%2C74&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The Wedding Veil</strong></a> by Kristy Woodson Harvey</p>
<p>I have been telling Matt that we need to go to the Biltmore for years. One day, I’ll succeed. This book knocked it out of the park for me. The connection between all of the women in this book was so well written. I’d read a book on each person separately, but together, it just flowed. Julia’s story was my favorite - I liked watching her find her strength and footing. I would, hands down, want to be her friend in real life. Full of strong, independent women, <em>The Wedding Veil</em> was captivating.</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Im-Glad-My-Mom-Died-ebook/dp/B09JPJ833S/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3UIRG8WTFVV3P&amp;keywords=i%27m+glad+my+mom+died&amp;qid=1672176698&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=I%27m+glad%2Cdigital-text%2C69&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>I&rsquo;m Glad My Mom Died</strong></a> by Jennette McCurdy</p>
<p>There’s a reason this is on multiple top lists. Jennette McCurdy’s writing is unique and makes the book fly by. She has a dry sense of humor and tone throughout the book. I enjoyed it; her way of story-telling will pull you in and keep you there. There definitely are triggers in this book; they are not easy topics. I found myself sick to my stomach at times. It’s not something that can be avoided, as it’s part of her story. I knew as soon as I read this it was one of my top books of 2022. It is still sticking with me months later.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Part-Your-World-Abby-Jimenez-ebook/dp/B09BN2WNPP/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6VLF6PP27ODO&amp;keywords=part+of+your+world+abby+jimenez&amp;qid=1672176746&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=part+of+%2Cdigital-text%2C73&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Part of Your World</strong></a> by Abby Jimenez</p>
<p>This book has goats. If that doesn’t suck you in, I don’t know what will. But there’s also a hint of magic, plus telling your family off in the most professional way possible. I was rooting for Alexis and Daniel the entire way. Seeing them come together was an adventure in the best way. I laughed out loud multiple times when reading. This book is fabulous. That’s the best way to describe it. I recommend it to everyone - read it.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Soto-Back-Taylor-Jenkins-ebook/dp/B09SNYDGR9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1LUY13HVY46XY&amp;keywords=carrie+soto+is+back&amp;qid=1672176795&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=carrie%2Cdigital-text%2C75&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Carrie Soto is Back</strong></a> by Taylor Jenkins Reid</p>
<p>Carrie Soto, a character who appeared in <em>Malibu Rising</em>, is fierce. She is competitive; she is unwavering. I loved her. Her return to tennis was fascinating to read. I liked that, despite being “too old” to return to the limelight, she didn’t take anyone’s crap. She was Carrie through and through. Also, Bowe, what a guy. He added so much to this story. While this is a story about tennis, it’s a story about a father and daughter. Javier’s and Carrie’s scenes are some of my favorites. TJR is back with another great read. She makes it tougher and tougher to pick a favorite read of hers. I’ll save that to dissect another day.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Lovers-Emily-Henry-ebook/dp/B09BTQ9HW6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1WN43NBWQU2N3&amp;keywords=book+lovers+emily+henry&amp;qid=1672176816&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=book%2Cdigital-text%2C78&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Book Lovers</strong></a> by Emily Henry</p>
<p>Emily Henry is back on top for the second year in a row. I couldn’t wait to read this book - we came back from Boston on its release day. We were home less than 20 minutes before Matt drove me to Barnes and Noble to pick up my copy. I then immediately started reading and couldn&rsquo;t stop. I was so glad because I was a little worried I would be disappointed as I always am when I read a repeat author. I had to hope that I wouldn&rsquo;t be let down. I should’ve known that Emily Henry wouldn’t let me down.</p>
<p><em>Book Lovers</em> is two love stories in one book. It is a romance and a story about two sisters. I loved the moments between Nora and Charlie just as much as I loved the moments between Nora and Libby. I loved the mentions of NYC’s bookstores. I loved this book. I loved the audiobook. There is a reason Emily Henry is always on the Top Book lists. Read this. Read this. Read this.</p>
<p>Can Emily Henry pull off the three-peat in 2023? To be determined.</p>

<p>Curious what else I read? Check out my Goodreads list <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2022/54492720"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Well, there it is. The annual recap of Another Year of Books as promised. Another year has come and gone. It’s hard to believe but here we are.</p>
<p>Who knows what 2023 will bring? Maybe I’ll be so over reading, after 106 books, that I will take a long break. Just kidding, we all know that won’t happen. What else would I even do with my time? I’d probably just walk around the house aimlessly. How boring.</p>
<p>I hope that, no matter the type of year you had, books brought you joy. Maybe, instead, they just brought you a moment to be by yourself, or maybe an escape from something else going on. Maybe you read one book; maybe you read 52. You do you, my friends.</p>
<p>See you here in December 2023 for another annual recap.</p>
<p>Read on. Cheers.<br>
-Emily</p>
