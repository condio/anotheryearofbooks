<p>Fate is messing with Tess and Gus. First they meet at 18, both while traveling abroad. They share a brief moment about their mutual love of gelato. Gus is dealing with a loss, Tess doesn’t know one is coming. So begins their separate, yet interconnected, lives for the next sixteen years.</p>
<p>Tess was bound for university (this takes place in England, so I can say university), but a loss keeps her home, taking care of her younger sister, Hope. After years of wondering why Hope seems so different, Hope is diagnosed with Asperger’s, and Tess puts her dreams on hold to be around. She relies on her friend who is keeping a secret from her, and is looking to find her dream.</p>
<p>Gus is the dutiful son, headed to medical school because it is what his parents want, especially after his brother is killed. He follows the rules, finds the perfect girl, doesn’t talk about grief, until one day when another woman impacts his life. Then comes a wife, a family, changes to that family, and a desire to do good.</p>
<p>Eventually, Hope no longer needs Tess around as much, and Gus finds himself in an empty house. Then fate has its way of moving things along. After sixteen years, Tess’s and Gus’s paths cross yet again.</p>
<p>For a debut novel, this is a good one. At times it did move a little slowly, but generally, it was an easy read that had a good amount of depth. It was clear Eberlen did her research regarding Asperger’s and breast cancer. Her writing just moves, without feeling forced, and she makes you relate to both Tess and Gus with ease.</p>
<p>I’d highly suggest going to your local library and picking up this book to read. While it seems lengthy when you look at the number of pages (433 to be exact), it doesn’t feel long. Eberlen’s debut novel is a worthy read.</p>
