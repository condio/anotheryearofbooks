    <p>There were multiple times when reading this book and typing this post when the song from Les Miserables “One Day More” started playing in my head. I can even picture the movie seen when Hugh Jackman is belting out “ONE DAY MOREEEE” when Helena Bohnam Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen jump in with “watch ‘em run amuck.” Maybe even this is a result of buying tickets to see Hugh Jackman in October? We may never know.</p>
<p>The title of the song and the title of this book do differ. But you see the coincidence right?</p>
<p>Book Read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-More-Day-Mitch-Albom/dp/1401309577/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3354S5L1NVNWN&amp;keywords=for+one+more+day+by+mitch+albom&amp;qid=1567681659&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=for+one+mo%2Caps%2C180&amp;sr=8-1">For One More Day</a></p>
<p>Author: Mitch Albom</p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 33</p>
<p>For One More Day is a fictitious story about Charles “Chick” Benetto, who after the death of his mother, is frankly, a mess. He’s developed an alcohol problem, leading to his daughter not inviting Chick to her wedding. Because of all of this, Chick decides to take his own life.</p>
<p>Late at night, he fumbles his way to his hometown, where his mother greets him like no time has passed. One thing is odd though - his mother has been dead for 8 years. That begins an “ordinary” day of reconnecting with the dead and those on the verge of death. </p>
<p>For One More Day is a story of a mother-son bond that goes beyond life. Chick learns what his mother gave up for him, secrets he never knew about a man he worshiped, and a new energy to see another day. </p>
<p>I have read Tuesday’s with Morrie and The Next Person You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom before. When I saw this book at the library’s book sale (there it is again!), I figured I’d give it a try.</p>
<p>This book, in all of its 197 pages, passes the time quickly. It is an easy read that can be completed in a couple of days. Albom’s other writing is thoughtful, and makes you ponder. This one is no different. It makes you think - what would you do if you had one more day with one person? </p>
<p>Is this book far fetched? Yes, it is. But even with the far fetched aspect, you’ll be intrigued to know the outcome. The novel starts with a scenario when the narrator meets Chick, setting the stage for a life story that is unlike any other. There, Chick begins to tell his story of an extraordinary day. When the day is over (as all days end), the novel ends with a quick story from another minor character. This part honestly caught me off guard - didn&rsquo;t seem fully necessary, but it worked.</p>
<p>Overall, For One Day More will make you think, keep you reading, and pass the time, especially on the bus. </p>
