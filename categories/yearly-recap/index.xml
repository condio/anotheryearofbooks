      <description>2020 - what a year, am I right? It’s been a tough one, especially this holiday season. Thankfully, it’s coming to a close and the future is looking like it will be more normal. But then again, isn’t less normal sometimes more fun? Maybe, maybe not; it probably depends on what that less normal looks like.
The end of the year means it&amp;rsquo;s time to look back on the books I’ve read, pick a few winners, pick a few losers, and round out the year with a recap, just as I have done in 2018 and 2019.</description>

      <description>Another year has already come and gone. I can’t believe it. I still can’t believe that I read all 52 books in 2019. I was filled with doubt and, mostly, annoyance at myself. But then, after I finished, all I felt was pride, and a little tired. This one is always the hardest… the recap. Which books were the best? Which were the worst? Which books are waiting for Hallmark to pick them up?</description>

      <description>Well, 2019 is approaching, surely and quickly, and there’s nothing we can do to slow it down. As 2018 comes to a close, and the goal is officially complete (and then some), it felt like it was time to think back, remember to the good days (or reads), and the bad ones (again, or reads), especially when we are all feeling like this:
I had to dig a little deep to remember which books I liked the most, because there were so many of them.</description>
