&lt;p&gt;Back before we all stayed home, I visited my aunt and grandparents to play cards. Itâ€™s one of our favorite things to do. Books came up as part of the conversation, as they usually do. My aunt told me I needed to read this book next. She even brought her copy to lend to me. Turns out, I already bought it on my latest trip to Half Price Books. After I finished Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I bumped this one up to next on my list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
