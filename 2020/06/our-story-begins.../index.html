<strong>Author:</strong> Lisa Wingate<br>
<strong>2020 Book Count:</strong> 23</p>
<hr>
<p>The &ldquo;story begins on a sweltering August night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Memphis 1939, the five Foss siblings are growing up on the Mississippi River, on board their family’s shantyboat. One evening, when their mother is taken to the hospital while in labor, Rill, the oldest, is left in charge. Unexpectedly, they are taken from their shantyboat and sent to a Tennessee Children’s Home Society orphanage. There, they learn that the promise to see their parents again soon was a lie, and Rill, feeling ultimately responsible, begins to fight to keep her siblings together. It&rsquo;s not easy when Georgia Tann and the Tennesee Children&rsquo;s Home Society are trying to seperate them.</p>
<p>In present day, Avery Stafford has returned to Aiken, South Carolina to help her father through a health crisis. She appears to be destined to follow in her father’s, and her grandfather’s, footsteps, and eventually run for senator. During a nursing home visit, Avery encounters May Crandall, who thinks Avery is Fern. After talking to May, Avery begins to look into her grandmother’s life, not knowing what secrets she might find. As she digs more into “Sisters’ Day,” Avery learns of a past, unknown to all.</p>
<p>Shifting between the present day and 1939, several family’s histories begin to unravel. As Rill describes the events of the Children’s Home,  Avery works with Trent Turner to uncover how May and Grandma Judy could know each other. A family’s history may never be the same.</p>
<hr>
<p>This book was a recommendation from my aunt, after she listened to the audio book. She has yet to lead me astray with a book suggestion, and this one was no different. Keep the recommendations coming, Aunt!</p>
<p>Having both the story from 1939 and present day allows readers to see a bigger picture and to begin putting the pieces together. Out of the two storylines, I preferred the story of Rill Foss and her siblings. While I did enjoy Avery’s investigation into the past, it wasn’t as consuming as Rill’s. Her story was one of determination, struggle, and the love of a family. I found myself wanting to get back to Rill’s story while reading about Avery’s; however, you need both the present and past to bring together the story.</p>
<p><em>Before We Were Yours</em> is a fictional tale based on real events. The Foss and Stafford families are fictional, but their stories could be real. The Tennessee Children’s Home Society was run by Georgia Tann for decades; during that time, Tann and her organization stole thousands of children from their birth parents, only to, in turn, make a huge profit from exorbitant adoption fees. Other children died in her care, never to be heard of again. Tann died in 1950 before the results of an investigation were made public. Even after her death, Tann still had a large number of officials and powerful people in her pocket. It would be another 40+ years before Tann’s records were unsealed. At that point, it was too late for a lot of families. For decades, Tann’s actions had, and still have, an impact on thousands upon thousands of lives.</p>
<p>Lisa Wingate paints a story based in truth. It was clear she had done her research, and put together an enticing story on a family’s history. This book taught me about a dark time in history, where children and babies became “objects” rather than human beings. It was a piece of history I knew very little about prior to reading. After reading this book, I found myself googling the Tennessee Children&rsquo;s Home to learn more. At the end of her book, Wingate also includes a &ldquo;note from the author,&rdquo; which gives more background and provides other readings if you would like to learn more. I learned a lot from that single section of the book.</p>
<p><em>Before We Were Yours</em> is a story of families, struggle, determination, loss, hope, and sisterhood. Ultimately, it is a worthy read.</p>
