      <description>For as long as I can remember, I have loved to read. I remember a picture where I fell asleep with a Samantha American Girl doll book draped over my face. Reading was a hobby. Year after year, one book came after another.
Then college began, and reading fell on the priority list.  Honestly, I don’t remember reading anything but textbooks and Facebook feeds during the school year (summers - replace textbooks with books and keep the Facebook feeds).</description>
