    <p>Back to fiction we go with another <em><a href="https://links.theskimm.com/share/referral_code?query=ZW1haWw9ZW1wb3dlbGwyNDMwQGdtYWlsLmNvbSZyPTk2MGQ2NGIyJnNoYXJlLXRyYWNrPVIxJmlzc3VlLWRhdGU9MjAxOC0wMi0wMg==">Skimm</a></em> recommendation. According to this novel, the Navajo do not have words for “I love you.” They believe that no one can possess another. Instead, they say “I’m glad about you” (I did consult the Google on this and can’t find any evidence to the contrary). Either way, a fitting title for this read. </p>
<p>**Book Read: **<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glad-About-You-Theresa-Rebeck/dp/0735215243/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517770156&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=i%27m+glad+about+you">I’m Glad About You</a></em></p>
<p>**Author: **Theresa Rebeck</p>
<p>**Books Read: **8</p>
<p>Rebeck tells the story of two on-and-off high school sweethearts. One dreams of being a famous actress, the other dreams of opening a medical clinic in Ecuador. As they navigate through their twenties, their lives continue to intersect, making each wonder, maybe the other was a part of their dream.</p>
<p>Alison and Kyle met in a high school parking lot after a football game. There begins years of on-and-off, hot and cold, speaking and not speaking. They start off hot, not being able to keep their hands of each other (well, kind of – there is pretty big reference to Catholicism, if you get my drift). Then words are exchanged, a break-up ensues, and so begins intertwined lives.</p>
<p>Alison struggles to make it, and finally hits it big, starring in a steamy TV show (seriously, the way Rebeck describes some of the scenes, this show definitely is on HBO, not regular cable), learning the ins and outs of the entertainment world. After a steamy almost encounter with Kyle, Alison bolts out of Cincinnati and from her family, all to avoid even discussing Kyle. When she eventually lands a movie that is supposed to be major, after starting a relationship with the director (starting may not be the best word here), Alison finds her every move, and outfit, being controlled. But even when life deals her a blow, she finds herself drifting back to that world.</p>
<p>Kyle, who dreamed of making a difference, becomes a pediatrician and marries the first woman he meets after Alison (again, do you catch my drift?). He knows how to speak Navajo, struggles with fitting in with his own family, finds comfort at a retreat at a monastery, ventures to a friend’s to watch the steamy TV show, bonds with the children he treats but not his own, and finds himself questioning some of his life decisions. But when life throws him a lemon, Kyle finds refuge in religion, in talking slowly, and is still not sure if he should change his life.</p>
<p>Then life hits. Add in an almost hook-up, stolen jewelry, a revealing argument about their dreams, an affair, and a purposely delayed message leading to an unfortunate meeting, and you’ve got <em>I’m Glad About You.</em></p>
<p>This book is well written, and moves pretty fast – I read it in only a few days, without falling asleep on the bus (always a good sign). Once I got so far, I didn’t want to put it down. Parts of this were difficult to read, because of all that is going on in, not only the entertainment industry, but in the world regarding the treatment of women. This book was published in 2016. Was Rebeck giving us an inside look into what is actually going on or did she just guess? Either way, parts of this did make me uncomfortable, knowing what we all know today.</p>
<p>Usually when reading, I am pretty good at predicting the ending – this one did not finish as I guessed. I’m still not sure if it was a good thing, if I liked the ending, or if I’m slightly bitter because I was wrong. Whichever it may be, overall <em>I’m Glad About You</em> was a quick, easy read that will make you glad you picked it up.</p>
<p>Next Read: <em>Your Fathers, Where Are They? And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever</em> by Dave Eggers</p>
