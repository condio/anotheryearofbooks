    <p>Another Year of Books started with an Elin Hilderbrand novel. In fact, it started with <a href="https://www.anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/01/the-first-three-of-2018.html">three.</a> She’s appeared <a href="https://www.anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/08/here-comes-bride-maybe.html">over</a> and <a href="https://www.anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/12/class-dismissed.html">over</a> again ever since. It’s a cycle: Hilderbrand writes a book, I read it, Hilderbrand writes a book, I read it. I blame my sister. If I remember correctly, she started reading Hilderbrand’s books first, then I picked them up. Now, we alternate who buys the newest one. FYI - she bought this one. (Guess the next one is on me, Meghan.)</p>
<p>Book Read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316420018/ref=cm_sw_r_em_tai_oV.KDbZ9HTJVX">Summer of ‘69</a></p>
<p>Author: Elin Hilderbrand</p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 36</p>
<p>The Summer of ‘69: a man lands on the moon, Ted Kennedy drives a car of Chappaquiddick, and for the first time, the entire Levin family will not be in Nantucket. Why? Kirby is headed to Martha’s Vineyard, looking for a summer job and an escape from the past few months. Blair is stuck in the summer heat in Boston, pregnant with twins. And Tiger has been drafted and is fighting in the Vietnam War. </p>
<p>Thirteen year old Jessie makes the trip to Nantucket with her mother and grandmother, already dreading the summer months. But when she arrives, she discovers their caretaker’s grandson is also staying for the summer. Young crushes will be developed. </p>
<p>Meanwhile in Martha’s Vineyard, Kirby finds herself drawn to Darren, while trying to help a friend who is in a rough relationship. In Boston, Blair’s husband Angus wants a stay at home wife and mother and doesn’t agree with Blair’s dream to be a professor. </p>
<p>Their mother Kate is angry and finds comfort in the bottle, pushing it to the extremes. Being trapped in Nantucket with her mother doesn’t seem to be helping. Kate’s husband has refused to come to Nantucket until the drinking stops, and wants to be seen as a full member of the Levin family. </p>
<p>By the end of the summer, hearts will be broken, letters will be written, engagements will be made, women will stand up for themselves, and secrets will be revealed. All in the Summer of ‘69.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be surprised if I haven’t read the majority of Hilderbrand’s novels. Is Summer of ‘69 her best work? No, it is definitely not. I enjoyed many others more than I enjoyed this one. That doesn’t mean I didn’t like it. It’s just that she has done better.</p>
<p>While I understand that Kate is dealing with her favorite child being drafted, for the majority of the book, she is whiny. Finally she sees the light, but until that happened, she just bothered me. Meanwhile, Blair is accepting of her husband’s opinion that she give up her dreams. I wanted to smack some feminism sense into her. I know it was different times, and eventually Kirby gets to her, but it’s ‘69, not ‘49.</p>
<p>Jessie’s character development (metaphorically and physically) was a winner. I was routing for her the entire book. I had doubts for the other members of the Levin family, but they pulled through, as they usually do. </p>
<p>Hilderbrand has a gift when it comes to bringing multiple stories into one. She always has. While this one may not make it to my top reads (by Hilderbrand or otherwise), it is a book that will keep you occupied at the beach or on a hot fall day, when you wish you were at the beach. </p>
<p>After all, Hilderbrand books are best read with your toes in the sand. Maybe we should make that a requirement for the next Hilderbrand novel. Hmm, something to think about. </p>
