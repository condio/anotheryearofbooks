    <p>We all know the holiday season is busy. It never seems like there is enough time to shop, bake, cook and wrap. Add in a book that seems to drag. Trust me, it does not help this time of year.</p>
<p>Book Read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Hard-Can-Be-Novel/dp/1250086086/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543870060&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+hard+can+it+be+by+allison+pearson">How Hard Can It Be?</a></p>
<p>Authors: Allison Pearson</p>
<p>Number of Books Read: 50</p>
<p>Kate Reddy’s life has changed - her adorable kids are now teenagers obsessed with video games and selfies, her family relocated to a house in need of serious work, and her husband, Richard, has decided that bicycling and therapy are better than his job as an architect. So Kate is looking for a new job, but being 49 isn’t very appealing to many companies.</p>
<p>She is trying her best to be fine with her age - accepting the pre-menopause, going to a Women Returners meeting for women going back to work, dealing with aging parents and in-laws. But an interview with her former company comes up, and 42 sounds better than 49. It does the trick - and Kate is back, marketing the hedge fund she created years before.</p>
<p>Kate then finds herself back in the investment world. Enter her former flame who sees a future Kate isn’t convinced of yet, a daughter who is realizing selfies and bullying friends aren’t anything, and a son who may be running up his mom’s credit card.</p>
<p>Add in a husband that finds solstice with a younger, spiritual woman, in-laws who need a lot of help, a sister with financial issues, and friends who support Kate, no matter what way she turns, and finally an admittance of her age at work.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is a sequel to I Don’t Know How She Does It. I picked it up because the cover and description on the sleeve sounded interesting. Reading the first book may have helped, but really, the book does not indicate it’s a sequel anywhere!</p>
<p>The first 100 pages of this book dragged. For the first time in some time, I found myself avoiding picking up a book. I played on my phone on the bus, continued Rollercoaster Tycoon on my iPad after work, until finally after a third of the book, the plot picked up.</p>
<p>At that point, the book became slightly entertaining. Kate was funny at points, and reading her interactions with people at work, from Russian mobsters to a client who tests Kate by asking her to ride a horse, improved my opinion of this book. But at times, Kate seemed to be whining - about work, her age, her husband, the house that needs a lot of work. Once you get through those pages, How Hard Can It Be? Picks up.</p>
<p>All in all, this one took me a while to read. Like I mentioned, I had little desire to read it. If you have read Pearson’s first novel, you may want to read this one. If you haven’t, I’d suggest another book (any book really).</p>
<p>Here’s to number 51 being better!</p>
