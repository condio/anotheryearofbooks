      <description>Well, 2019 is approaching, surely and quickly, and there’s nothing we can do to slow it down. As 2018 comes to a close, and the goal is officially complete (and then some), it felt like it was time to think back, remember to the good days (or reads), and the bad ones (again, or reads), especially when we are all feeling like this:
I had to dig a little deep to remember which books I liked the most, because there were so many of them.</description>

      <description>In January, it all began with an Elin Hilderbrand book. Well, actually it began with multiple Elin Hilderbrand books. It seemed fitting that my 52nd read should be her latest winter novel. On Black Friday, thanks to Amazon, it was purchased. Then it laid around waiting to be read.
So without further ado, the 52nd read of 2018.

      <description>This past week seemed to calm down. Only plan was to do some Christmas shopping. Thank goodness my list is small. Maybe next year everyone will get a print out of this blog accompanied by a book? Just a thought.

      <description>We all know the holiday season is busy. It never seems like there is enough time to shop, bake, cook and wrap. Add in a book that seems to drag. Trust me, it does not help this time of year.

      <description>title: &amp;lsquo;A Power Couple Writes a Book&amp;rsquo; date: 2018-11-24T06:14:00.000-08:00 draft: false When I found myself at the library one day at lunch (again), I couldn&amp;rsquo;t not pick this one up. I mean look at the cover above.
See what I mean?
It’s Karen (also Tammy) and Ron (also the Plumber) telling their story. Each has their own books but this one was different. The two come together to write this one.</description>

      <description>It’s becoming more and more difficult to pick which book I read. Since I’m on the last leg of 52 for the year, I feel as if I should make sure they are good ones (PS - this one worked out in my favor). But my time for reading 52 this year is quickly dwindling. I feel like I woke up one morning and it was Halloween, and the next thing I knew I was figuring out what I’m doing on Turkey Day.</description>

      <description>Surprise! It’s already mid-November. The year is continuing to fly by. I’m looking forward to the Christmas cookies, and Thanksgiving dinner. Not looking forward to thinking about Christmas gifts. Too soon, Father Time, too soon. But on another note, not too many books left to read!

      <description>I saw this book at Target once, and added it to my list to read. Target is great for this by the way - gives you an excuse to go pick up a few items you need. I then forgot I saw it at Half Price Books, bought it, and put it on my bookshelf…I then borrowed it from the library and read that copy.
It took me until 5 days after I finished this book (and another) to realize what I had done.</description>

      <description>It’s the end of October, and we are on book number 45. I can see the end in sight - pending I get to the library at lunch today because I have nothing to read on the bus. Can we do it? I’m thinking we can.

      <description>It’s fall already. FALL. Time for boots, pumpkin patches, and being cold waiting for the bus. This year is flying by, as it usually does. Maybe it’s all the stuff going on, or maybe it’s because I’ve read book #44 already and can (hopefully) see the end in sight.

      <description>Completing this read means there’s less than 10 books to go until I can call this mission complete. It’s the beginning of October so I have hope. But it’s officially the final countdown. Good or bad, we read on.

      <description>The past two weeks have been busy, so I’ve been MIA for awhile. First my sister got married (that wore me out for days), then this next book was decently long, then there were concerts to go to, plays to usher and a new car to be bought. But we are back and after this, we only have ten more till the goal!

      <description>I was supposed to pick a happier book to read for number 40. After all the suspenseful, slightly disturbing reads, my boyfriend told me it would be a good idea. This read has a happy ending but is pretty socially relevant all at the same time.

      <description>Sometimes, I don’t have a reason for picking up at pickup at the library. If it’s not a book on my ever-growing iPhone list titled “Books,” it may be someone, somewhere told me to read it. Or in this case, the cover reminds be of a Fredrik Backman novel. That alone is enough to make me read a book.

      <description>Ever since I saw the movie version of The Notebook before I read the book (loved both by the way), I have always tried to read books before I watch the movie. See The Mountain Between Us as an example. This movie had serious Oscar buzz, but let’s not let that stray us from tradition here.

      <description>I mentioned I read two books during my weekend of relaxation in Sea Isle City. You already know I liked the first - did I like the second?

      <description>I spent this past weekend completely relaxed on vacation in Sea Isle City, NJ. My plans consisted of eating, drinking, walking, sitting in the sand with SPF 50 on, and reading a book or two. All objectives: met.
My boyfriend’s objectives: take some photos with his drone. Objective: met.

Spoiler: two books were read during the weekend - but let’s only focus on one for now.)

      <description>“Got a secret, Can you keep it? Swear this one you’ll save. Better lock it, in your pocket, Taking this one to the grave.”
Keep in mind, all I know about Pretty Liars is this theme song. I once tried to watch it with my sister and she became so annoyed with my questions, told me not to watch it and I’m pretty sure changed the channel.
I only bring it up because the theme song was constantly playing in my head as I read book #31 of 2018.</description>

      <description>But maybe, there actually is? The Beaver library’s annual book sale came in for the win again when I found the next read just lying around, waiting to be purchased (along with about 8 others that filled my bag). I’m a big believer in reading the book before you see the movie based on it (did it in reverse for The Notebook and we all know that movie is fantastic). So when I found this next read, I had to buy it.</description>

      <description>This book was a hand-me down, which always seems to work out well for me. This one went from Massachusetts to Brooklyn to Carnegie (and will probably go to Beaver next). It reminded me a book that you would read while sitting on a beach chair, feet in the water, SPF 50 on and getting some sun. (Or maybe SPF 75 - your call).

      <description>This book has been on my list for a while now. It worked out that one day in the Big Apple while visiting my sister and her fiancé, it rained. We looked for something to do. Matt suggested the Amazon Book store…. yes the Amazon book store (NYC has these things). Perfect opportunity to buy a new book, no?

      <description>I know it has been awhile - almost 2 weeks to be exact. But, when I went to the library (not at lunch this time – big change for me!) when I was almost done with my last read, I picked up not 1, but 2 books, and they were meant to be read and talked about together. So here you go – a two for one post.

      <description>My sister is getting married. My best friend’s sister is also getting married. Yesterday when we met for lunch, we were comparing the size of the guest lists. But this book trumped us - the wedding of the century with 888 guests. Eight hundred and eighty eight. Wow, sorry Meghan for commenting on the size of yours.

      <description>I tend to find books as I’m wandering the library at lunch. Sometimes, if I can’t find a book on my “to read” list, I pick one based on the cover, the author, or if I saw other people looking at it. Usually, it works out pretty well. This one… I’m still not convinced that picking a book because Powell was in the author’s name was a good idea. You win some, you lose some.</description>
