    <p>2020 - what a year, am I right? It’s been a tough one, especially this holiday season. Thankfully, it’s coming to a close and the future is looking like it will be more normal. But then again, isn’t less normal sometimes more fun? Maybe, maybe not; it probably depends on what that less normal looks like.</p>
<p>The end of the year means it&rsquo;s time to look back on the books I’ve read, pick a few winners, pick a few losers, and round out the year with a recap, just as I have done in <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/12/another-year-of-books-the-2018-recap/">2018</a> and <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/01/another-year-of-books-the-2019-recap/">2019</a>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here it is… the Annual Recap of Another Year of Books, 2020 Edition.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-shout-out-to-the-rom-coms">A Shout Out to the Rom-Coms</h3>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/03/to-the-window-to-the-wall/"><strong>The Proposal</strong></a> by Jasmine Guillory</p>
<p>I’ve read all of Guillory’s books at this point. <em>The Proposal</em> just might be my favorite. It has a “friends with benefits” feel to it that I enjoyed. It’s corny, it’s funny, and slightly serious, all in one.</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/05/love-it-if-we-made-it/"><strong>The Happy Ever After Playlist</strong></a> by Abby Jimenez</p>
<p>In her sequel to <em>The Friend Zone</em>, Jimenez tells another heartfelt, entertaining story that includes charm, tragedy, humor and music. It begins with a dog jumping through a sunroof - how can a book that starts with that go wrong?</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/12/the-2020-finale/"><strong>Beach Read</strong></a> by Emily Henry</p>
<p>Looking for a rom-com about rom-coms? This is your book. It does come with some emotional baggage; it&rsquo;s a fast, enjoyable read.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-memoirs-to-read">The Memoirs to Read</h3>
<p>Programming Note: I only read three memoirs this year, but all are worthy of being listed here.</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/04/yas-queen/"><strong>Over the Top</strong></a> by Jonathan Van Ness</p>
<p>First, go binge watch <em>Queer Eye</em> on Netflix if you haven’t already. Then, read Van Ness’s memoir. It’s sassy, it’s deep, and it’s worthy of a “Yas, Queen!”</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/01/guess-whos-back.../"><strong>Me</strong></a> by Elton John</p>
<p>The first read of 2020. It seems like so long ago. Elton John brings nothing but honesty to this read. Turn on some tunes, sit back and pick up <em>Me</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/02/a-drop-of-golden-sun/"><strong>Home Work</strong></a> by Julie Andrews</p>
<p>It’s a memoir by Julie Andrews. Do you need any other reason to read it? Probably not; I mean it’s Mary Poppins / Maria Von Trapp for goodness’ sakes!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-let-downs">The Let Downs</h3>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/02/im-the-wife/"><strong>The Wife</strong></a> by Meg Wolitzer</p>
<p>There is not much to say about this one, except I hated it. Skip it.</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/10/see-you-next-year/"><strong>28 Summers</strong></a> by Elin Hilderbrand</p>
<p>Hilderbrand let me down with <em>28 Summers</em>. I usually enjoy her books, but with this one, I couldn’t wait for it to end. It seemed stale. I didn’t hate it, but I didn’t love it. I just liked it, but not much. I still have hope that her next novel will be better.</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/09/adulting/"><strong>All Adults Here</strong></a> by Emma Straub</p>
<p>It’s been months, and I still can’t figure out what the point of this book is. I couldn’t figure it out right after I read it either. Sometimes, that’s a good thing. Not in this case. Skip this one. Read one of Straub’s other books instead.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-few-i-didnt-write-about">A Few I Didn&rsquo;t Write About</h3>
<p>I read 58 books this year but only wrote about 31 of them. Because of that, I wanted to give you a quick peek into a few favorites didn’t make AYOB.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-White-Royal-Blue-Novel/dp/1250316774/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36IVGBNPOBCP4&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=red%2C+white+and+royal+blue&amp;qid=1609422592&amp;sprefix=red%2C+white%2Caps%2C200&amp;sr=8-1"><strong>Red, White &amp; Royal Blue</strong></a> by Casey McQuiston</p>
<p>The First Son of the USA and the Prince of England hook up, and it brings all the drama. This one is a little risque and a whole lot of juicy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074C3WPG5?ref_=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_tkin&amp;binding=kindle_edition"><strong>Rock Chick</strong></a> Series and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0842K18WH?ref_=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_tmmp&amp;binding=mass_market"><strong>Dream Team</strong></a> Series by Kristen Ashley</p>
<p>I discovered Kristen Ashley in June after just browsing the Internet looking for books to read. I picked up one of her <em>Rock Chick</em> books and then I couldn’t get enough. At this point, I’ve read a good number of her books. Are they the greatest? Definitely not. Do I love them? Yes. They are a bit outrageous and I can’t get enough! I’ve really enjoyed her latest series <em>Dream Team</em> - two of the books are out thus far, and I am looking forward to the next two in 2021. Here’s to some more rom-coms!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-local-author">The Local Author</h3>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/08/a-hometown-shout-out/"><strong>Love, Chocolate, and a Dog Named Al Capone</strong></a> by Abigail Drake</p>
<p>AYOB&rsquo;s first local author! This book was a gift, purchased at a book festival in my hometown. Even before I started it, it was a winner. A retelling of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, narrated by a dog named Capone, this one tells the story of a local bookstore owner who is looking for her Mr. Darcy. With the help of Capone, she just might find him.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-3-peaters-or-two-of-them">The 3-Peaters (Or Two of Them)</h3>
<p>Both of the others below have had three posts* about their books on AYOB. I was inspired to include this section because I recently watched The Last Dance on Netflix, and it had my mind on the 3-peat.</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/08/kevin-kwan-is-back"><strong>Sex and Vanity</strong></a> by Kevin Kwan</p>
<p>I was so excited to see Kevin Kwan had a new book because I absolutely loved the <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> series. <em>Sex and Vanity</em> definitely was not as crazy, but it still brought the drama, the laughs, characters you’ll be rooting for, and a little bit of sabotage.<br>
(*I&rsquo;ll admit - Kwan has had 4 books on AYOB, but only 3 actual posts, so he qualifies for this category.)</p>
<p><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/09/make-a-wish/"><strong>What Your Wish For</strong></a> by Katherine Carter</p>
<p>Carter is a three-peater on AYOB for a reason. In her latest book, Carter mixes serious moments with Hallmark-esque ones. It’s an emotional story about choosing to feel the joy in life even after the darkest of times.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="and-finally-the-top-three-reads-of-2020">And Finally, The Top Three Reads of 2020:</h3>
<p>I decided to limit my top books to three this year, mostly because there are three easy standouts. I felt picking two more to make it a “Top Five'' would be difficult. Frankly, I just didn’t want to think about it too much.
So, without further ado, the Top Three Books of 2020:</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/04/you-have-hope-as-each-new-day-dawns/"><strong>We Were the Lucky Ones</strong></a> by Georgia Hunter</p>
<p>Based on the true story of Hunter’s family, <em>We Were the Lucky Ones</em> tells the story of the Kurc family, beginning in 1939. As a Jewish family in Poland, they are torn apart as World War II rages on. Follow the parents, Sol and Nechuma, and their five adult children (plus their spouses) over the span of a decade across different parts of the world. All have one thing that drives them forward - the hope that one day, they will see each other again. The story will suck you in, keeping you on the edge of your chair as you wait to find out the fate of each family member. It’s a story of hope and courage, even in the darkest of times.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/12/lets-runaway/"><strong>The Vanishing Half</strong></a> by Brit Bennett</p>
<p>Bennett tells a story of twins who run away, leaving behind a small black community. One secretly passed for white. The other eventually returns to her hometown, which has a lasting impact on her daughter. The Vanishing Half is a story about identity, race, secrets, and choices. It shows how one decision can have a lasting impact. There is a reason this novel is on the top book lists pretty much everywhere. It was Book of the Month’s Book of the Year; it made President Obama’s top list, it’s on Amazon’s. It’s on mine. It’s as good as everyone says it is.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/11/a-story-about-a-lot-of-things/"><strong>Anxious People</strong></a> by Fredrik Backman</p>
<p><em>Anxious People</em> is, at its core, a story about idiots. It’s also a story about a bank robbery, a hostage situation, a love story, and a bridge. But mostly, it’s the idiots and the worst group of hostages ever. In the course of a day, nine strangers will work through their own issues while helping each other along the way. Fate works in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>It was a close call between <em>Anxious People</em> and <em>The Vanishing Half</em> for my top pick. Both were SO GOOD. It came down to one simple thing - I loved the weirdness of <em>Anxious People</em> a little more than I loved the seriousness of <em>The Vanishing Half</em>. Not much more, but it was enough to edge <em>Anxious People</em> to the top spot.</p>
<p>Backman continues to be one of my favorite authors. I have yet to not enjoy one of his novels. This one is odd, but in the best way. At first, I doubted the synopsis; I thought it would be too odd. Backman proved me wrong. It’s a worthy pick of the Top Spot of 2020.</p>
<hr>
<p>I decided at the end of 2019, I wouldn’t worry about reading 52 books in 2020. I would instead read what I want, when I want, and at the speed I want. It did take some of the pressure off. Looking back, I didn’t think I would end up reading 58 books. Then again, I also didn’t think that most of 2020 would be spent in my house.</p>
<p>To all of you, thank you for continuing to read this blog I started on a whim three years ago. I have appreciated every book recommendation, every email saying you’ve added a book to your list, every read of a post, and every like on a picture, more than you know.</p>
<p>I hope that in this tough, weird year, books have given you a reprieve to the craziness, just like they have for me.</p>
<p>I will see you all here in 2021. Until then, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!<br>
-Emily</p>
