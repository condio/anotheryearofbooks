<p>Anytime you are waiting for the next book in a series, it feels like the release date takes forever to arrive. This is exactly what happened to me with this next read. I read the second book in the series after it came out last December. I pre-ordered the third for my Kindle. When I saw that Barnes &amp; Noble had the third book in stock the weekend before the offical release day, I cancelled my Kindle pre-order and headed to the store. Now, I’m back to waiting for the fourth book, which comes out in November&hellip; the countdown is on.</p>

<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Spinner-Team-3/dp/1538733935/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1X6NQS2HOTEX1&amp;keywords=dream+spinner+kristen+ashley&amp;qid=1621943596&amp;sprefix=dream+spinner%2Caps%2C157&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Dream Spinner</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Kristen Ashley      <br>
<strong>2021 Book Count:</strong> 21</p>
<hr>
<p>In the third book of the <em>Dream Team</em> series, Hattie Yates knew from the moment she met him that Axl Pantera was the guy for her. She already is super shy; but Hattie also uses her shyness to keep her distance, hiding away years of verbal abuse from her father. After Axl witnesses a breakdown, Hattie fears her dream of Axl will just disappoint her.</p>
<p>Axl is willing to put in the work, but there is only so much the guy can take. He’s made it pretty obvious what he wants is Hattie. When Hattie is put in danger, Axl is ready to step in; not only to protect her, but to prove that they are meant to be.</p>
<p>Add in the commandos, the women of Smithie&rsquo;s, a unsuspected ally, and a still unsolvable crime, and you&rsquo;ve got <em>Dream Spinner</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I mentioned in the <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/12/another-year-of-books-the-2020-recap/">2020 recap</a> that I had read a good number of Kristen Ashley’s books, but never wrote about them. I decided this time around, I’d post about the newest and latest read.</p>
<p>Like Kristen Ashley’s other books, <em>Dream Spinner</em> is charming; it’s funny; it’s sassy; it has very serious moments. Yes, this is a romance novel, but it is so much more than that too. It has suspense and continues the plotline that has been in the past two books, while also adding in it’s own flair. Like I mentioned, I’ve read a good number of Ashley’s books, including a few whole series, and one thing she does so well is bringing in characters from other books. It’s never too much. The recurring characters always add something.</p>
<p>Plus, it doesn’t hurt that no matter the plot, Ashley’s books (including this one) always seem to have one important theme flowing through them - friendship.</p>
<p>I didn’t rush through reading <em>Dream Spinner</em>; I opted to take my time over a few days because I was enjoying it so much. There were a good amount of times I actually giggled out loud when reading. You walk in knowing part of the outcome (it is a romance novel, after all), but that doesn’t mean Ashley won’t throw you a curve ball or two. One person may have started off as quite the bad guy, but you’ll be rooting for him, as well as Axl and Hattie the entire way.</p>
<p>As for the main couple, both Axl and Hattie are dealing with their own family dramas. As they work through that as well as personal history, their story is pretty swoon-worthy. I look forward to seeing more of them in the fourth book of this series.</p>
<p><em>Dream Spinner</em> is a romance novel worth reading (after, of course, you go back and read <em>Dream Maker</em> and <em>Dream Chaser</em>). I didn’t want to put it down, especially after the epilogue and sneak peek of the fourth book - <em>Dream Keeper</em>.</p>
