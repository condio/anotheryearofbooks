    <p>It’s been awhile. At least it seems like it. 2019 is here, holiday decorations are coming down, the weather is see-sawing and can’t make up its mind, and right now, in Pennsylvania, it’s, frankly, frigid as heck.</p>
<p>I’ve still been reading, just not typing. We’re also trying to build a 1500 piece puzzle (as you can see, it’s a slow process over 3 weeks in).</p>

<p>But the first book of 2019 is officially complete. How could we not start the year with a new number 1 best seller?</p>
<p>Book Read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1547397039&amp;sr=8-1">Becoming</a></p>
<p>Authors: Michelle Obama</p>
<p>Number of Books Read, 2019 Edition: 1</p>
<p>We all know Michelle Obama: former First Lady, mother, lawyer, winner of push up competitions. Now, add best selling author to her list.</p>
<p>Obama tells her story from the very beginning. From growing up in the South Side of Chicago, raised by a mother who always put her family first, and a father who never let multiple sclerosis stop him from working, to her impressive career as a lawyer with all the stories in between. Becoming follows Michelle Robinson as she becomes Michelle Obama, as she struggles to decide to stay in a career with better paycheck or leave for one that makes a difference, and how IVF led to a complete family.</p>
<p>She openly talks of loss, sudden deaths, and why she agreed when Barack Obama wanted to go into politics. Then she discusses her hesitancy when he wanted to run for president, and how she agreed because she wasn’t sure he would win.</p>
<p>Well, we all know the outcome of that one. Obama then takes us on her journey as First Lady. She includes stories of meeting the Queen, sneaking out to see the White House lit up in rainbow colors,and wishing Lin Manuel Miranda luck when he thought Alexander Hamilton embodied hip hop.</p>
<p>But she also discusses how it wasn’t all good moments, and is very open about the impact of tragic events. From beginning to end, Obama is nothing but honest and open.</p>
<p>I’ve been waiting to read this one. I mean, it’s Michelle Obama! She’s one strong, powerful, and inspiring woman.</p>
<p>She did not disappoint. I loved this book. I will admit - it did start off slow. You have to power through the first 60-70 pages when the pages feel a little longer than others. But then I hit a point where I couldn’t stop reading. (It seemed to start right when Obama went to college.) Some of her stories were entertaining, some were sad, some had you rooting for the outcome you already knew would happen. Most importantly, each page was open and honest. I mean, come on, she tells you she didn’t think Barack Obama would become president at first and how she accidentally touched the Queen’s shoulder when they first met.</p>
<p>Becoming is the story of a woman who even at the top, feels the pressure to act a certain way, who felt the impact of being part of the first African American first family, and is still making her voice is heard. It’s a number one best seller for a reason, and Becoming is a great memoir to start off 2019. It may be hard to beat.</p>
