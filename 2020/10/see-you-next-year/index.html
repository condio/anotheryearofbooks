<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/28-Summers-Elin-Hilderbrand-ebook/dp/B084WYDYLW/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=28+summers&amp;qid=1601467062&amp;sr=8-3"><em>28 Summers</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Elin Hilderbrand<br>
<strong>2020 Book Count:</strong> 45</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1993, Mallory inherited a beachfront cottage in Nantucket and is hosting her brother’s small bachelor party. There, she finally meets Jake McCloud, her brother’s frat brother whom she’s talked to over the phone. When everyone else leaves, Jake and Mallory form a bond that never seems to break.</p>
<p>That first summer together, they make a decision. Jake will come to Nantucket once a year for Labor Day weekend, thus beginning a “same time, next year” relationship. It’s a relationship that will withstand marriages, children, and a political rise. Each year, both Jake and Mallory patiently wait for their weekend together.</p>
<p>Then in the spring of 2020, a phone call from Mallory’s son will change everything.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have read almost every one of Elin Hilderbrand’s books. Some I love, some I like, some I don’t care for. This is one I just liked; didn’t love it, didn’t hate it. It was 100 pages too long for me and could’ve been shorter and sweeter. I commented to my sister that I thought it was too long; her reply was that she couldn’t believe it had 4.5 stars out of 5 on Amazon. I agreed.</p>
<p>There were some things I liked about this book. I liked how the prologue actually gave away the end and then we were taken back in time. It didn’t bother me that the characters were inserted into real life events, like a Supreme Court judge confirmation. I liked Mallory’s brother Cooper.</p>
<p>No matter what I liked, I couldn’t get behind the premise of this one. Usually, Hilderbrand’s books suck me in. This one seemed to push me away. Yes, I get this was based on the movie Same Time Next Year. If the book is based on a couple meeting once every year, please include more of their weekends in the story. A good amount of the chapters in this one don’t even discuss their weekends together.</p>
<p>I found myself wishing <em>28 Summers</em> was shorter in length and that someone would just choose to make the relationship an all the time thing. I ended the book hoping that Hilderbrand’s next summer novel will be way better than this one.</p>
<p>There is one more Elin Hilderbrand book coming to AYOB soon - her final book in the Paradise series. I bought the first two, read them, and wrote about them. The third book should be here Tuesday. Stay tuned to see if that one goes better than this one.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Next Read:</strong> Stay tuned.</p>
