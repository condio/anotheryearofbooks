<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Second-First-Impressions-Sally-Thorne/dp/0062912852/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=second+first+impressions&amp;qid=1622563628&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Second First Impressions</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Sally Thorne        <br>
<strong>2021 Book Count:</strong> 23</p>
<hr>
<p>Ruthie Midona has worked in Providence Retirement Villa’s for the past six years. At 25, she lives a secluded life, happy in her bubble at Providence, and plans to stay there forever. Ruthie hopes that if she can get through her boss’s absence without injury, she’ll become the new manager. Then, after that, she’ll focus on putting herself out there and finding a date. The temp in Ruthie’s office has even come up with a method to put Ruthie out there.</p>
<p>Enter Teddy Prescott, tattoo artist and son of the new buyer of Providence. He needs somewhere to crash and a job. Two 90 year old women are looking for an assistant; one that will clean, shop, render flattery, and pretty much do everything they say, when they say it. Teddy is the new man for the job.</p>
<p>Their first impression… not great. The second one, not much better. But when they become neighbors, their impressions of each other change as they form a friendship. But Ruthie has no plans to leave, and Teddy has no plans to stay.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I saw that <em>Second First Impressions</em> was coming out, I immediately added it to my Books Wish List on Amazon for safe keeping. I did that because I really enjoyed <em>The Hating Game</em> by Sally Thorne and was excited to read this new one. So, I put it on hold at the library, and I waited, and I waited, and I waited. If I remember correctly, when I first reserved it, it was going to take six weeks.</p>
<p>It did not disappoint. <em>Second First Impressions</em> is a cute, entertaining, likeable read. Yes, it is ultimately predictable. The ending was a little rushed. But it had heart. I liked how different Ruthie and Teddy were, yet they had so much in common, all at the same time. The supporting characters also had development; Melanie stops wandering and finds her place; Reneta and Aggie, even at 90, are full of surprises for each other. Each outside character added to the story, and helped both Ruthie and Teddy find their way.</p>
<p>I didn’t enjoy this one as much as <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/03/not-even-close-not-even-a-little-bit-not-even-at-all/"><em>The Hating Game</em></a>, and that’s ok. There will always be an author’s book that you like more than the rest. That doesn’t mean you stop reading their work. Plus, the Parlonis are a hoot, and I like to think the endangered tortoises in this one are adorable. I look forward to whatever Sally Thorne has planned next.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Second First Impressions</em> is a delightful read, full of fun, some laughs, and a whole lot of heart.</p>

<p><strong>Next Read:</strong> <em>People We Meet on Vacation</em> by Emily Henry</p>
