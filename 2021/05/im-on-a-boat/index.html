<p>It seems like almost every time I go to Target, my book list grows by at least one, sometimes more. Occasionally, I actually buy the book I see, like when I bought <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2021/03/so-kiss-me/"><em>One to Watch</em></a>; other times, I just add the book to my Amazon list for future reference. I stumbled upon this next read on a Target run. It sounded fun. Then, Amazon sent a promo code to buy it for my Kindle. I usually can’t turn down the promo codes, so here we are with book #18.</p>

<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Promised-Land-Barack-Obama/dp/1524763160/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1620063583&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shipped</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Angie Hockman     <br>
<strong>2021 Book Count:</strong> 18</p>
<hr>
<p>Henley Evans works hard. She barely has time to breath between her job and night classes for her MBA. As a marketing manager of a popular cruise line, she promotes cruises, but never takes any. The thorn in her side - Graeme Crawford-Collins, the social media manager. They have never met in person, but Graeme pushes her over the edge in emails alone.</p>
<p>When both Henley and Graeme are short listed for a huge promotion, their boss sends them on a company cruise to the Galapagos Island. Their goal is to create a proposal about boosting bookings; the winner takes the promotion. Henley is determined not to be distracted by real Graeme; her career goals are the most important thing to her.</p>
<p>But real Graeme is completely different than she thought. First impressions are not always right. As they travel on a week-long cruise together, Henley begins to look at her life differently. Yes, her career is important, but what’s living without living a little?</p>
<hr>
<p>This was exactly what I needed after finishing <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2021/05/thanks-obama/"><em>A Promised Land</em></a>. I started reading this book on a Friday; I stayed up reading it later that night. By Saturday evening, I finished the book. It was mindless. It was corny. It was quick. I liked it. Like I said, it was just what I needed.</p>
<p><em>Shipped</em> is a quirky novel. Some of the things that happen to Henley are laugh-out-loud funny. There were a few times while reading, I started giggling. Matt would ask me what was so funny, and the answer was scenes in this book. I try not to spoil anything here, but there were differently some good scenes in <em>Shipped</em>. There may be some karaoke, some flamingos, a drunken phone call, and a bizarre bathroom encounter.</p>
<p>Hockman does feature a good amount of romance in this one, but she also focuses a good amount on Henley’s career. I could see that some people may think there is not enough focus on the romance aspect, but I disagree. It was well balanced. I enjoyed reading about Henley’s career goals and how focused she was. I wanted to punch her misogynistic boss in the face (and I’m not the only one). Trust me, it would have been well deserved.</p>
<p>Henley was a relatable, likeable, admirable character. She was a strong, independent, determined woman, who wasn&rsquo;t going to let anything stand in her way. I was rooting for her the entire time. Graeme was definitely not a distraction. He too was likable, but he was also shy and adjusting after life threw him for a loop. I was rooting for him too.</p>
<p><em>Shipped</em> reminded me of some of Christina Lauren’s good books (not <em>The Honey Don’t List</em>), <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/03/not-even-close-not-even-a-little-bit-not-even-at-all/"><em>The Hating Game</em></a> by Sally Thorne, and <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2020/12/the-2020-finale/"><em>Beach Read</em></a> by Emily Henry. Sometimes being reminded of other books is not a good thing. In this case, it was. The ending, in this case, was a welcome surprise. It was fun, eventful, and a good stick-it-to-the-man moment, just like the entire book was.</p>
