<hr>
<p>Imagine spending seven days in quarantine with your family. There’s no beach, no vacation, no escaping, no high quality WiFi. You’re in quarantine. Nobody can come in, nobody can go out (well, they at least aren’t supposed to).</p>
<p>This is how the Birch family will spend their Christmas holiday. It’s the first time Emma’s and Andrew’s eldest daughter, Olivia, has been home for the holidays in quite some time. She is also the reason behind their quarantine - Olivia, a doctor, has been fighting a deadly disease and needs a week to be sure she is clear to be in the outside world again. Phoebe, the youngest daughter, is wrapped up in wedding plans, set to marry a man who may have a pretty big secret he doesn’t want to admit. She seems to, at times, live in la-la land.</p>
<p>Andrew has received a letter that will alter his family forever, and Emma is waiting to talk about a health issue, that will impact all of them. While Andrew hids away in his study, Emma wonders if she made the right choice asking him to come home, all those years ago. Phoebe eventually has to make a choice - family or social life? And Olivia copes with the outcomes of a deadly virus. When a stranger arrives, nothing will ever be the same.</p>
<p>In seven days, many secrets are revealed, a family comes back together with a few additions, and a different health scare could add to the biggest addition of them all. God may have made the world in seven days, but can the Birch family survive them?</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. I love my family. Really, I do. But seven days in quarantine with them does not sound promising. Shit may hit the fan. Then again, it may not. Let’s not find out. </p>
<p>While this book wasn’t as quick of a read as <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/08/here-comes-the-bride-maybe/"><em>The Perfect Couple</em></a>, it was enjoyable. Actually, it may have been a little slower because this book had more substance. While reading, it was evident that Hornak did her research when writing about a deadly disease (it&rsquo;s a fictional disease but the symptoms and impact are realistic). All in all, read this one. It’s factual, entertaining, and a great read. </p>
<p>Pick up this book, imagine you’re stuck in this situation, and you’ll be glad you’re reading about it instead of living it. Unless you’d like to be stuck in one house with your closest family members without the Internet and no one is allowed to leave? To each their own. </p>
