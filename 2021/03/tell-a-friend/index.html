<p>It&rsquo;s been a minute or two since there was a new post on Another Year of Books. After reading <a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2021/02/lend-me-your-ears/"><em>Group</em></a>, I quickly read through three other books (but didn&rsquo;t post about them). By the end of February, I had already finished 10 books this year, so I decided to take a break. I couldn’t get myself to pick up one of the many books I have to read from my bookshelves; instead, I spent my time skimming books I have read before, which is what I do everytime I can’t get myself to focus on one book.</p>
<p>On March 5, I picked up this next book. It was a Barnes &amp; Noble monthly pick in January, and I found it when we stopped to browse one day.</p>

<p><strong>Book Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authenticity-Project-Novel-Clare-Pooley/dp/1984878638/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1615811150&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Authenticity Project</em></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Claire Pooley<br>
<strong>2021 Book Count:</strong> 11</p>
<hr>
<p>One day, a lonely artist, Julian Jessop, goes to Monica’s Cafe and leaves behind a plain green journal. He has titled it “The Authenticity Project,” and includes his story as the first. Monica sees the journal and tries to return it to no success; afterwards, she reads Julian’s entry and writes her own. Then, she leaves it in a wine bar across the street where it is picked up by a stranger.</p>
<p>And so it goes, until six strangers are connected by a single notebook. Their lives have unexpectedly become intertwined. Monica wants to bring lonely Julian out of his shell; Alice is an Instagrammer whose online life is much more impressive than her real life; Hazard is an addict who vows to get sober and help a stranger find her match along the way. Riley finds his way to the cafe after another points him in the direction; other strangers, including secondary characters, find their lives changed by a notebook.</p>
<p>As their lives begin to mix in Real Life, each person finds that the truth just might set them free. It might also bring true friendships and love along the way.</p>
<hr>
<p>At first, I could not get into this book. I’m still not sure if it was the book itself, or just that I had a week or so where I couldn’t get into any book. Luckily, around page 50, I gained momentum and <em>The Authenticity Project</em> picked up speed. By the time I got over half way through, I wanted to keep reading it without stopping. I wrapped up the second two-thirds of the book quickly.</p>
<p><em>The Authenticity Project</em> was charming. That’s the best way I can describe it. There wasn’t a single character I disliked. Each had their own unique journey, but it was well mixed with the others. Individual chapters focused on a certain character’s viewpoint, but also included the interactions with others, shaping their relationships. It never felt choppy and was easy to follow.</p>
<p>At times, yes, this book is predictable. Then again, most books are. Could I have predicted some of the character’s outcomes? For sure. Others, I didn’t see coming. It’s always nice when there is a surprise in a book. This one has a few along the way. It is also a story about living off your phones, off social media, in the authentic world, and how things are not always as they seem.</p>
<p>Overall, if you are looking for a charming, relatively quick read, <em>The Authenticity Project</em> is a book for you. It’s humorous, enjoyable and honest, all in one.</p>
