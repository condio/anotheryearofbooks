  <div class="content">
    <p>When I read the third part of the <em>Me Before You</em> trilogy was due to come out, I had to have it right away because Louisa Clark’s story wasn’t over yet. I loved <em>Me Before You,</em> I loved <em>After You</em>. So I asked my BF, who has Amazon prime, to buy <em>Still Me</em>. After a purchase of the wrong book (way to go, Matt), the book was on its way and I was ready to read.</p>
<p>(SPOILERS AHEAD – this I where I stop anyone who has read <em>Me Before You</em> and _After You_and may want to read this one. Or if you have always wanted to read the series, stop now. Seriously STOP. STOP NOW. Go read the book(s) and then come back to read this post)</p>
<p><strong>Book Read:****<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Still-Me-Novel-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0399562451/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519604692&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=still+me+by+jojo+moyes">Still Me</a></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> JoJo Moyes</p>
<p><strong>Number of Books Read:</strong> 12</p>
<p>Louisa Clark has had an interesting few years. Lou lived in her comfort zone, stuck there because of something that happened in her past. Enter Will Traynor and a job that changes her life forever. Lou found herself trying to avoid new things, Will found himself wishing for a completely different life. As Lou tries to convince Will how great life can be, he shows her the same. Outcomes are what they are, and Lou’s life is forever changed.</p>
<p>Then in <em>After Me,</em> Lou finds herself back in a funk, until a freak accident lands her back in her parents’ home and the town that she wanted to get away from. Enter Ambulance Sam, a man who has lost and has baggage of his own. Sam helps Lou get her groove back and together they realize life together may just be worth living.</p>
<p>In <em>Still Me,</em> Moyes concludes the trilogy, following Lou’s story as she takes on the Big Apple, and through her new job, finds herself thrown into the society of the Fifth Avenue elite, working as a personal assistant for Leonard Gopnik’s much younger second wife, Agnes. Lou navigates schedules, a long distance relationship, and a plot twist involving Agnes’ former life. Louisa is determined to make the most out of the experience and find her full potential, no matter what secrets she holds.</p>
<p>Ambulance Sam and Lou have their issues, Nathan is still a steadfast, consistent friend, a Will-look alike makes a move, the next door neighbor’s dog bites, Lou’s family has its ups and downs but are still always there, Trena is loving life in London and you’re still rooting for Ambulance Sam.</p>
<p>When Lou’s life is thrown another curve, she finds herself in a new situation, with a new friend who helps her answer: “Who is Louisa Clark?” Louisa then makes a decision that is truly hers, with a question that needs an answer.</p>
<p>I loved these books before I read <em>Still Me</em>, and I love these books after reading it. I couldn’t put it down – read it in 3 days. Moyes nails yet another one. If you can put this down, more power to you. Moyes’ writing is funny, romantic, and frankly, the bees’ knees. You’ll instantly connect with the characters, both familiar and unfamiliar, and you’ll be internally shouting what you think Louisa should do. It’s not easy to write about the “after”, but Moyes concludes the <em>Me Before You</em> trilogy with the best one yet.</p>
<p>Hello Louisa Clark, welcome back.</p>
