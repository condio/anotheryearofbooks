<hr>
<p>I had no idea there were two follow on books to <em><a href="https://anotheryearofbooks.com/2018/02/this-next-book-is-insanely-good/">Crazy Rich Asians</a>.</em> When I found out, I knew I had to read them. If you are looking for a world beyond belief where people have more money than Bill Gates, I highly recommend them for you too.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s start with <em>China Rich Girlfriend.</em></p>
<p>About two years have passed. Rachel Chu is getting married to the fabulous Nick Young, who gave up everything (and I mean everything) for her. Nick’s mother Eleanor is still trying to meddle. But this time, her meddling, while a good thing because of a chance encounter, causes a crashed wedding, a health scare, and an adventure of a lifetime.</p>
<p>The adventure of a lifetime take a now-married Rachel and Nick to Shanghai, entering the world of Carlton, a twenty-something with “Prince Harry” like antics (pre Meghan Markle of course), and his girlfriend/girl who is a friend/hook-up buddy Colette (the biggest social media star in China), where nights are endless, the gifts keep coming, and a spur of the moment trip to Paris is just an everyday thing.</p>
<p>But Carlton is harboring a secret that changed his life forever, Colette is the only one who knows and isn’t afraid to use if to her advantage (she is not a pleasant person), and Rachel is still hoping to spend time with a man she has waited her whole life to meet. Enter a health scare that is absolutely terrifying and a video that goes viral, and Rachel’s life is still crazy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nick’s cousin Astrid is learning the downsides of having a newly rich husband and his quest for the top. Kwan provides another entertaining story line in Katherine Tai (aka Kitty Pong, former soap opera star) and her attempts to cross over to the elite side of things. She hires people to teach her the ways of the uber-rich and is willing to spend an absurd amount of money to get there. Her story continues in….</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s finish with <em>Rich People Problems.</em></p>
<p>Su Yi, the matriarch and fierce leader of the Young family, is on her deathbed (this is not a spoiler, it is described in the cover). Nick Young returns to Singapore after five years away, and is definitely not the only one. The family has gathered at Tyersall Park (Su Yi’s massive estate), to all claim their piece of the inheritance, especially since Su Yi hasn’t talked to her favorite grandson (Nick) in quite some time.</p>
<p>The battle is on to be the favorite family member, and some are willing to lie their way to the top.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kitty Pong is back, as Kitty Bing, stepmother of Colette. Her battle is on to outdo her stepdaughter (who she has never met). Colette may be married to a duke and is working to save the orangutans, but has she actually changed? Talk to Carlton to find out.</p>
<p>Combine an ex-wife deranged with jealousy, an estranged husband who wants an insane amount of money, long held secrets that change the future of the estate forever, a mother-in-law who really wants a grandchild, planes with massage parlors, and a private island that you need a snorkel to get to… and again, they are still crazy and they are still rich.</p>
<hr>
<p>Kwan continues to entertain with his writing. Again and again, he takes us into a world that is completely unimaginable to me. It’s a constant page turner, wondering what will happen next. As soon as I finished <em>China Rich Girlfriend,</em> I immediately picked up <em>Rich People Problems</em>. Kwan, with his footnotes to describe the meaning of things with some sass, kept me reading, with a story-telling unlike most others.</p>
<p>A side note: as of this post, this blog has almost 1000 views. I started writing this because I love to read, and frankly, even if 2 people read it, I’d have something to do. So as we approach 1000 views, thank you. To everyone who subscribes and gets an email at 5 am the next day, to those who click the link on Facebook, to my coworkers who have the same taste in books and make recommendations, and to those who tell me they’re glad I started this and to keep it up… thank you. Here’s to 2000!s</p>
